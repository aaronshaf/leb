			<p><verse-number id="Dt 31:1">1</verse-number>And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. <verse-number id="Dt 31:2">2</verse-number>And he said to them, “I am <supplied>a</supplied> hundred and twenty years old <idiom-start/>today<idiom-end/>;<note>Literally “the day”</note> I am not able to go out and to come <supplied>in</supplied> <supplied>any</supplied> longer, and Yahweh said to me, ‘You may not cross this Jordan.’ <verse-number id="Dt 31:3">3</verse-number>Yahweh your God <supplied>is about to</supplied> cross <idiom-start/>before you<idiom-end/>;<note>Literally “to the face of you”</note> he will destroy these nations <idiom-start/>before you<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “to the face of you”</note> and you shall dispossess them. Joshua <supplied>will be</supplied> crossing <idiom-start/>before you<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “to the face of you”</note> <supplied>just</supplied> as Yahweh <idiom-start/>promised<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “spoke”</note> <verse-number id="Dt 31:4">4</verse-number>And Yahweh will do to them <supplied>just</supplied> as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and to their land, which he destroyed with them. <verse-number id="Dt 31:5">5</verse-number>And Yahweh <idiom-start/>will deliver them to you before you<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “will give them Yahweh to the face of you”</note> and you shall do to them according to every commandment that I have commanded you. <verse-number id="Dt 31:6">6</verse-number>Be strong and be courageous; you should not be afraid, and you <idiom-start/>should not be in dread from their presence<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “not you should dread from their face”</note> for Yahweh your God <supplied>is</supplied> the <supplied>one</supplied> going with you; he will not leave you alone and he will not forsake you.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Dt 31:7">7</verse-number>Then Moses summoned Joshua, and he said to him <idiom-start/>in the presence of all Israel<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “before the eyes of all Israel”</note> “Be strong and be courageous, for you will go with this people into the land that Yahweh swore to their ancestors<note>Or “their fathers”</note> to give to them, and you will give it to them as an inheritance. <verse-number id="Dt 31:8">8</verse-number>Yahweh <supplied>is</supplied> the <supplied>one</supplied> going <idiom-start/>before you<idiom-end/>;<note>Literally “to the face of you”</note> he will be with you, and he will not leave you alone, and he will not forsake you; you shall not be afraid, and you shall not be discouraged.” <verse-number id="Dt 31:9">9</verse-number>So Moses wrote this law, and he gave it to the priests, the descendants<note>Or “sons”</note> of Levi, the <supplied>ones</supplied> carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and to all the elders of Israel. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Dt 31:10">10</verse-number>Then Moses commanded them, <idiom-start/>saying<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “to say”</note> “At the end of seven years, in the time of the year for canceling debts during the Feast of Booths, <verse-number id="Dt 31:11">11</verse-number><idiom-start/>when all Israel comes to appear before<idiom-end/><note>Literally “at/in the coming of all of Israel to see”</note> Yahweh their God at the place that he will choose, you shall read this law before all Israel <idiom-start/>in their hearing<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “in their ears”</note> <verse-number id="Dt 31:12">12</verse-number>Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little children and your aliens that are in your <idiom-start/>towns<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “gates”</note> so that they may hear and so that they may learn and they may revere Yahweh your God, and <idiom-start/>they shall diligently observe<idiom-end/><note>Literally “they shall keep to do”</note> all the words of this law. <verse-number id="Dt 31:13">13</verse-number>And <supplied>then</supplied> their children,<note>Hebrew “child”</note> who have not known, they <supplied>too</supplied> may hear, and they may learn to revere Yahweh their God all the days <idiom-start/>that you live<idiom-end/><note>Literally “that you are alive”</note> on the land that you <supplied>are</supplied> crossing the Jordan <idiom-start/>to get there<idiom-end/><note>Literally “there”</note> to take possession of it.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Dt 31:14">14</verse-number>Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Look, <idiom-start/>you are about to die<idiom-end/>;<note>Literally “are near your days to die”</note> call Joshua and present yourselves in <supplied>the</supplied> tent of assembly,<note>Or “meeting”</note> so that I may instruct him.” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in<note>Or “at”</note> <supplied>the</supplied> tent of assembly.<note>Or “meeting”</note> <verse-number id="Dt 31:15">15</verse-number>And Yahweh appeared in the tent in a column of cloud, and the column of the cloud stood at the entrance of the tent. <verse-number id="Dt 31:16">16</verse-number>And Yahweh said to Moses, “Look, you <supplied>are</supplied> about to lie <supplied>down</supplied> with your ancestors,<note>Or “fathers”</note> and this people will arise and they<note>Hebrew “he”</note> will play the prostitute after <idiom-start/>the foreign gods<idiom-end/><note>Literally “the gods of the foreigner/foreign person of the land”</note> of the land <idiom-start/>to which they are going<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “which he is going to”</note> <verse-number id="Dt 31:17">17</verse-number>And <idiom-start/>my anger shall flare up against them<idiom-end/><note>Literally “shall become my nose against it/him”</note> on that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they<note>Hebrew “he”</note> shall become as prey, and disasters and troubles shall find<note>Or “encounter”</note> them,<note>Hebrew “him”</note> and they<note>Hebrew “he”</note> shall say on that day, ‘<supplied>Is it</supplied> not because our<note>Hebrew “my” but represents all the people</note> God is not in our<note>Hebrew “my”</note> midst <supplied>that</supplied> these disasters have found<note>Or “encountered”</note> us?’<note>Hebrew “me”</note> <verse-number id="Dt 31:18">18</verse-number>But I will certainly hide my face on that day, because <supplied>of</supplied> all of the evil that they<note>Hebrew “he”</note> did because they<note>Hebrew “he”</note> turned to other gods. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Dt 31:19">19</verse-number>“And so then write this song for yourselves and teach it to the <idiom-start/>Israelites<idiom-end/>;<note>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</note> put it in their mouth, so that this song may be for me as a witness against the <idiom-start/>Israelites<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</note> <verse-number id="Dt 31:20">20</verse-number>For when I bring them<note>Hebrew “him,” referring to the people</note> into the land that I swore to their<note>Hebrew “his”</note> ancestors,<note>Or “fathers”</note> a land flowing with milk and honey, <idiom-start/>they will eat their fill<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “he will eat and he will be satisfied”</note> and they<note>Hebrew “he”</note> will become fat, and <supplied>then</supplied> they<note>Hebrew “he”</note> will turn to other gods, and they will serve them, and they will spurn me, and they<note>Hebrew “he”</note> will break my covenant. <verse-number id="Dt 31:21">21</verse-number><idiom-start/>And then<idiom-end/><note>Literally “And it shall happen”</note> many disasters and troubles will come upon them,<note>Hebrew “him”</note> and this song will give evidence before them<note>Hebrew “him”</note> as a witness, because it will not be forgotten from <supplied>out of</supplied> the mouth of their descendants,<note>Hebrew “his offspring/descendant”</note> for I know their<note>Hebrew “his”</note> inclination that they<note>Hebrew “he”</note> <supplied>are</supplied> having <idiom-start/>today<idiom-end/><note>Literally “the day”</note> before I have brought them<note>Hebrew “him”</note> into the land that I swore.” <verse-number id="Dt 31:22">22</verse-number>And Moses wrote this song on that day and taught it <supplied>to</supplied> the <idiom-start/>Israelites<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</note> </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Dt 31:23">23</verse-number>Then he<note>That is, Yahweh</note> told Joshua the son of Nun, and said <supplied>to him</supplied>, “Be strong and be courageous, for you shall bring the <idiom-start/>Israelites<idiom-end/><note>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</note> into the land that I swore to them, and I will be with you.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Dt 31:24">24</verse-number><idiom-start/>And then when Moses finished writing<idiom-end/><note>Literally “And it happened as/when to finish Moses to write”</note> the words of this law on the scroll <idiom-start/>until they were complete<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “until their to be complete/”</note> <verse-number id="Dt 31:25">25</verse-number>then Moses commanded the Levites carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, <idiom-start/>saying<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “to say”</note> <verse-number id="Dt 31:26">26</verse-number>“Take the scroll of this law and put it at the side of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and it will be there as a witness against you. <verse-number id="Dt 31:27">27</verse-number>For I know your rebellion and your stiff neck <supplied>even now</supplied> while I <supplied>am</supplied> still alive with you <idiom-start/>today<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “the day”</note> rebelling against Yahweh, and <idiom-start/>how much more<idiom-end/><note>Literally “and also for/indeed”</note> after my death. <verse-number id="Dt 31:28">28</verse-number>Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your officials, so that I may speak in their ears these words, and <supplied>that</supplied> I may call as witness against them heaven and earth. <verse-number id="Dt 31:29">29</verse-number>For I know that after my death you will certainly act corruptly, and you will turn aside from the way that I have commanded you, and the disaster in the future days will befall you, because you will do evil<note>Hebrew “the evil”; the definite article indicates the general concept of evil</note> in the eyes of Yahweh, <idiom-start/>provoking him with the work of your hands<idiom-end/>.”<note>Literally “to provoke him with/by the work of your hands”</note> <verse-number id="Dt 31:30">30</verse-number>So Moses spoke into the ears of the assembly of Israel the words of this song <idiom-start/>until they were complete<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “until their to be complete”</note> </p>
