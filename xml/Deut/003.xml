And <supplied>so</supplied> you will do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites,<note>Hebrew “Amorite”</note> who <supplied>was</supplied> reigning in Heshbon.’ <verse-number id="Dt 3:3">3</verse-number>And <supplied>so</supplied> Yahweh our God also gave Og the king of Bashan, and all of his army<note>Or “people”</note> into our hand, and we struck him down until not a survivor remained to<note>Or “for”</note> him. <verse-number id="Dt 3:4">4</verse-number>And we captured all <supplied>of</supplied> his towns<note>Or “villages/cities <supplied>small</supplied>”</note> at that time; <supplied>there</supplied> was not a city that we did not take from them. <verse-number id="Dt 3:5">5</verse-number>All of these <supplied>were</supplied> fortified towns with high walls, gates, and bars,<note>Hebrew “bar”</note> <idiom-start/>apart from<idiom-end/><note>Literally “alone from”</note> very many <supplied>of</supplied> the villages of the open country. <verse-number id="Dt 3:6">6</verse-number>And <supplied>so</supplied> we destroyed them just as we had done to Sihon the king of Heshbon; <supplied>we destroyed</supplied> utterly each town of males, the women, and the little children. <verse-number id="Dt 3:7">7</verse-number>But all <supplied>of</supplied> the livestock and the booty of the towns we kept as spoil for ourselves.<note>Hebrew “us”</note> </p>

			<p><verse-number id="Dt 3:12">12</verse-number>And <supplied>so</supplied> we took possession of this land at that time, from Aroer, which <supplied>is</supplied> on the <supplied>edge of the</supplied> wadi<note>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> of Arnon, and <supplied>also</supplied> half of the hill country of Gilead and its towns I gave to the Reubenites<note>Hebrew “Reubenite”</note> and to the Gadites.<note>Hebrew “Gadite”</note> <verse-number id="Dt 3:13">13</verse-number>And the remainder of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, the whole region of Argo. All of that <supplied>area of</supplied> Bashan was called <supplied>the</supplied> land of the Rephaim. <verse-number id="Dt 3:14">14</verse-number>Jair the descendant<note>Or “son”</note> of Manasseh acquired the whole region of Argob, up to the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and he called it,<note>Hebrew “them”</note> <supplied>that is</supplied> Bashan, after his <supplied>own</supplied> name, Havvoth Jair, <idiom-start/>as it still is today<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “up to this day”</note> <verse-number id="Dt 3:15">15</verse-number>And <supplied>also</supplied> I gave Gilead to Makir. <verse-number id="Dt 3:16">16</verse-number>And to the Reubenites<note>Hebrew “Reubenite”</note> and to the Gadites<note>Hebrew “Gadite”</note> I gave, from Gilead up to the wadi<note>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> of Arnon, the middle of the wadi<note>A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season</note> <supplied>as a</supplied> boundary and up to the Jabbok <idiom-start/>River<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “wadi,” which here refers to a flowing river</note> the boundary of the <idiom-start/>Ammonites<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “sons/children of Ammon”</note> <verse-number id="Dt 3:17">17</verse-number>And the <idiom-start/>Jordan Valley<idiom-end/><note>Literally “Arabah”</note> <supplied>with</supplied> the Jordan <supplied>River as its</supplied> boundary, from Kinnereth<note>Or “Chinnereth,” the Sea of Galilee</note> up to the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea,<note>Or the Dead Sea</note> <supplied>with</supplied> the slopes of Pisgah toward the east. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Dt 3:18">18</verse-number>“And I charged you <supplied>all</supplied> at that time <supplied>when I</supplied> said, “Yahweh has given you—to <supplied>all of</supplied> you—this land to possess. All the <idiom-start/>warriors<idiom-end/><note>Literally “men of valor”</note> shall cross over, ready to fight, before your brothers, the <idiom-start/>Israelites<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</note> <verse-number id="Dt 3:19">19</verse-number>Only your wives and your little children and your livestock (I know that <idiom-start/>you have much livestock<idiom-end/>)<note>Literally “livestock much <supplied>there is</supplied> to you”</note> must stay in your towns that I have given you, <verse-number id="Dt 3:20">20</verse-number>until Yahweh shall give rest to your brothers as <supplied>he did</supplied> to you, and also they take possession <supplied>of</supplied> the land that Yahweh your God <supplied>is</supplied> giving to them beyond the Jordan; then they may return, each <supplied>one</supplied> to his possession that I have given to them. <verse-number id="Dt 3:21">21</verse-number>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, ‘Your eyes see all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings; so Yahweh will do to all <supplied>of</supplied> the kingdoms where you are about to cross over to. <verse-number id="Dt 3:22">22</verse-number>You shall not fear them, for Yahweh your God is the <supplied>one</supplied> fighting for you. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Dt 3:23">23</verse-number>“And I pleaded with Yahweh at that time, saying, <verse-number id="Dt 3:24">24</verse-number>‘Lord Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your strong hand, for what<note>Hebrew “who”</note> god <supplied>is there</supplied> in the heaven or on the earth who can do according to your works and according to your mighty deeds? <verse-number id="Dt 3:25">25</verse-number>Let me cross over, please, and let me see the good land <idiom-start/>that is beyond the Jordan<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “in the beyond of the Jordan”</note> this good hill country and Lebanon.’ <verse-number id="Dt 3:26">26</verse-number>But Yahweh was very angry with me because of you, and he would not listen to me, and Yahweh said, ‘<idiom-start/>Enough of that from you<idiom-end/>!<note>Literally “Much to you”</note> You shall not speak to me <supplied>any</supplied> longer about this matter! <verse-number id="Dt 3:27">27</verse-number>Go up <supplied>to</supplied> the top of Pisgah and <idiom-start/>look around you<idiom-end/><note>Literally “lift up your eyes”</note> toward the west, toward the north, and toward the east, and <idiom-start/>view<idiom-end/><note>Literally “look”</note> <supplied>the land</supplied> with your eyes, for you will not cross this Jordan. <verse-number id="Dt 3:28">28</verse-number>Now instruct Joshua and support him and encourage him because he himself<note>Emphatic use of the pronoun</note> will cross <supplied>over</supplied> before this people and enable them to inherit the land that you will see.’ <verse-number id="Dt 3:29">29</verse-number>So we remained in the valley opposite Beth Peor. </p>
