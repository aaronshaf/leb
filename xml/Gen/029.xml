			<pericope>Jacob Flees to Haran</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Ge 29:1">1</verse-number>And Jacob <idiom-start/>continued his journey<idiom-end/><note>Literally “lifted up his feet”</note> and went to the land of the Easterners.<note>Or “children of the east”</note> <verse-number id="Ge 29:2">2</verse-number>And he looked, and behold, <supplied>there was</supplied> a well in the field, and behold, there <supplied>were</supplied> three flocks of sheep lying beside it, for out of that well the flocks were watered. And the stone on the mouth of the well <supplied>was</supplied> large. <verse-number id="Ge 29:3">3</verse-number>And <supplied>when</supplied> all the flocks were gathered there, they rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well. And they watered the sheep and returned the stone upon the mouth of the well to its place. <verse-number id="Ge 29:4">4</verse-number>And Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where <supplied>are</supplied> you from?” And they said, “We <supplied>are</supplied> from Haran.” <verse-number id="Ge 29:5">5</verse-number>And he said to them, “Do you know Laban, son of Nahor?” And they said, “We know <supplied>him</supplied>.” <verse-number id="Ge 29:6">6</verse-number>And he said to them, “<idiom-start/>Is he well<idiom-end/>?”<note>Literally “Is it well for him?”</note> And they said, “<supplied>He is</supplied> well. Now look, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep.” <verse-number id="Ge 29:7">7</verse-number>And he said, “Look, <supplied>it is</supplied> still <idiom-start/>broad daylight<idiom-end/>;<note>Literally “high day”</note> it is not the time <supplied>for</supplied> the livestock to be gathered. Give water to the sheep and go, pasture them.” <verse-number id="Ge 29:8">8</verse-number>And they said, “We are not able, until all the flocks are gathered. Then the stone is rolled away from the mouth of the well, and we water the sheep.” <verse-number id="Ge 29:9">9</verse-number>While he was speaking with them, Rachel came with the sheep which belonged to her father, for she was pasturing <supplied>them</supplied>. <verse-number id="Ge 29:10">10</verse-number>And it happened <supplied>that</supplied>, when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother, Jacob drew near and rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well and watered the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother. <verse-number id="Ge 29:11">11</verse-number>And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept. <verse-number id="Ge 29:12">12</verse-number>And Jacob told Rachel that he <supplied>was</supplied> the relative of her father, and that he <supplied>was</supplied> the son of Rebekah. And she ran and told her father.<verse-number id="Ge 29:13">13</verse-number>And it happened <supplied>that</supplied> when Laban heard the message about Jacob, the son of his sister, he ran to meet him. And he embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. <verse-number id="Ge 29:14">14</verse-number>And Laban said to him, “Surely you <supplied>are</supplied> my flesh and my bone!” And he stayed with him a month. </p>

			<p><verse-number id="Ge 29:15">15</verse-number>Then Laban said to Jacob, “<supplied>Just</supplied> because you <supplied>are</supplied> my brother should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wage <supplied>should be</supplied>.” <verse-number id="Ge 29:16">16</verse-number>Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the older <supplied>was</supplied> Leah, and the name of the younger <supplied>was</supplied> Rachel. <verse-number id="Ge 29:17">17</verse-number>Now the eyes of Leah <supplied>were</supplied> dull, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance. <verse-number id="Ge 29:18">18</verse-number>And Jacob loved Rachel and said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.” <verse-number id="Ge 29:19">19</verse-number>Then Laban said, “Better <supplied>that</supplied> I give her to you than I give her to another man. Stay with me.” <verse-number id="Ge 29:20">20</verse-number>And Jacob worked for Rachel seven years, but they were as a few days in his eyes because he loved her. <verse-number id="Ge 29:21">21</verse-number>And Jacob said to Laban, “Give <supplied>me</supplied> my wife, that I may go in to her, for <idiom-start/>my time<idiom-end/><note>Literally “my days”</note> is completed.” <verse-number id="Ge 29:22">22</verse-number>So Laban gathered all the men of the place and prepared a feast. <verse-number id="Ge 29:23">23</verse-number>And it happened <supplied>that</supplied> in the evening he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him, and he went in to her. <verse-number id="Ge 29:24">24</verse-number>And Laban gave Zilpah his female servant to her, to Leah his daughter <supplied>as</supplied> a female servant. <verse-number id="Ge 29:25">25</verse-number>And it happened <supplied>that</supplied> in the morning, behold, it <supplied>was</supplied> Leah! And he said to Laban, “What <supplied>is</supplied> this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Now why did you deceive me?” <verse-number id="Ge 29:26">26</verse-number>Then Laban said, “<idiom-start/>It is not the custom<idiom-end/><note>Literally “it is not thus done”</note> in our country to give the younger before the firstborn. <verse-number id="Ge 29:27">27</verse-number>Complete the week of this one,<note>Leah; the wedding feast would last one week</note> then I will also give you the other, <idiom-start/>on the condition that you will work for me<idiom-end/><note>Literally “with respect to the work that you will work with me yet”</note> another seven years.” <verse-number id="Ge 29:28">28</verse-number>And Jacob did so. So he completed the week of this <supplied>one</supplied>,<note>That is, Leah</note> then he gave Rachel his daughter to him as a wife. <verse-number id="Ge 29:29">29</verse-number>And Laban gave Bilhah his female servant to Rachel his daughter as a female servant. <verse-number id="Ge 29:30">30</verse-number>Then he also went in to Rachel, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he served with him yet another seven years. </p>

			<p><verse-number id="Ge 29:31">31</verse-number>When Yahweh saw that Leah <supplied>was</supplied> unloved he opened her womb, but Rachel <supplied>was</supplied> barren. <verse-number id="Ge 29:32">32</verse-number>Then Leah conceived and gave birth to a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, “Because Yahweh has noticed my misery, that I <supplied>am</supplied> unloved. Now my husband will love me.” <verse-number id="Ge 29:33">33</verse-number>And she conceived again and gave birth to a son. And she said, “<supplied>It is</supplied> because Yahweh has heard that I <supplied>am</supplied> unloved that he gave me this <supplied>son</supplied> also.” And she called his name Simeon. <verse-number id="Ge 29:34">34</verse-number>And she conceived again and gave birth to a son. Then she said, “Now this time my husband will be joined to me, for I have borne him three sons.” Therefore, she called his name Levi. <verse-number id="Ge 29:35">35</verse-number>And she conceived again and gave birth to a son. And she said, “This time I will praise Yahweh.” Therefore she called his name Judah. And she ceased bearing children. </p>
