			<pericope>The Reign of Jotham</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ch 27:1">1</verse-number>Jotham <supplied>was</supplied> twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother <supplied>was</supplied> Jerusha the daughter of Zadok. <verse-number id="2 Ch 27:2">2</verse-number>And he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Uzziah had done—only he did not go into the temple of Yahweh. But the people still acted corruptly. <verse-number id="2 Ch 27:3">3</verse-number>He built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh, and <idiom-start/>he did much restoration<idiom-end/><note>Literally “he built much”</note> on the wall of Ophel. <verse-number id="2 Ch 27:4">4</verse-number>And he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and he built forts and towers in the wooded places. <verse-number id="2 Ch 27:5">5</verse-number>Now he fought with the king of the <idiom-start/>Ammonites<idiom-end/><note>Literally “sons/children of Ammon”</note> and prevailed against them. And the <idiom-start/>Ammonites<idiom-end/><note>Literally “sons/children of Ammon”</note> gave to him in that year one hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of wheat and ten thousand <supplied>measures of</supplied> barley. This <supplied>is what</supplied> the <idiom-start/>Ammonites<idiom-end/><note>Literally “sons/children of Ammon”</note> rendered to him, as well as in the second and third year. <verse-number id="2 Ch 27:6">6</verse-number>And Jotham strengthened himself, for he established his ways before Yahweh his God. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ch 27:7">7</verse-number>Now the remainder of the words of Jotham and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written upon the scroll of the kings of Israel and Judah. <verse-number id="2 Ch 27:8">8</verse-number>He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. <verse-number id="2 Ch 27:9">9</verse-number>And Jotham slept with his ancestors,<note>Or “fathers”</note> and they buried him in the city of David. And his son Ahaz became king in his place. </p>
