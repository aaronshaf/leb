			<pericope>Solomon’s Prayer for Wisdom</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ch 1:7">7</verse-number>On that night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask what I shall give to you.” <verse-number id="2 Ch 1:8">8</verse-number>Then Solomon said to God, “You yourself have shown steadfast<note>Or “great”</note> loyal love to David my father and have made me king in his place. <verse-number id="2 Ch 1:9">9</verse-number>Now, O Yahweh God, let your word to David my father be fulfilled, for you yourself have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth. <verse-number id="2 Ch 1:10">10</verse-number>Now, give to me wisdom and knowledge that I may go out and come in before this people, for who can judge this, your great people?” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ch 1:11">11</verse-number>Then God said to Solomon, “Because this was with your heart and you did not ask for wealth, possessions, honor, and the lives of your enemies, and also did not ask for <idiom-start/>long life<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “many days”</note> but have asked for wisdom and knowledge that you might judge my people over whom I have made you king, <verse-number id="2 Ch 1:12">12</verse-number>wisdom and knowledge is given to you. And I will <supplied>also</supplied> give to you wealth, possessions, and honor, the like of which was not had by the kings who <supplied>were</supplied> before you, nor will there be the like after you.” <verse-number id="2 Ch 1:13">13</verse-number>So Solomon went from the high place which <supplied>was</supplied> at Gibeon <supplied>to</supplied> Jerusalem before the tent of assembly.<note>Or “meeting”</note> And he reigned over Israel. </p>
