			<pericope>The Reign of Uzziah</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ch 26:1">1</verse-number>Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah (now he <supplied>was</supplied> sixteen years old) and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah. <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:2">2</verse-number>He built Elath and returned it to Judah after the king slept with his ancestors.<note>Or “fathers”</note> <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:3">3</verse-number>Uzziah <supplied>was</supplied> sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. And the name of his mother <supplied>was</supplied> Yecoliah of Jerusalem. <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:4">4</verse-number>And he did what <supplied>was</supplied> right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that Amaziah his father had done. <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:5">5</verse-number>And he began to seek<note>Or “was seeking”</note> God in the days of Zechariah who was teaching in visions of God. And <idiom-start/>whenever<idiom-end/><note>Literally “in the days”</note> he sought Yahweh God made him have success. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ch 26:6">6</verse-number>And he went out and made war against the Philistines, and he broke down the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod, and he built cities in Ashdod and among the Philistines. <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:7">7</verse-number>And God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabs who were living in Gur-Baal and Meunim. <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:8">8</verse-number>And the Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah, and his fame<note>Or “name”</note> went out to the boundary<note>Literally “to coming in”</note> of Egypt, for he became <idiom-start/>very strong<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “to above”</note> <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:9">9</verse-number>And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the Angle, and he strengthened them. <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:10">10</verse-number>And he built towers in the desert and hewed many cisterns, for he had much livestock, both in the Shephelah and on the plain, <supplied>along with</supplied> farmers and vinedressers in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil. <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:11">11</verse-number>And Uzziah had troops <idiom-start/>trained and ready for war<idiom-end/><note>Literally “making war, going out to fight”</note> in divisions according to the number of their enrollment at the hand of Jeuel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah of the king’s commanders. <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:12">12</verse-number>The whole number of the heads of the <idiom-start/>families<idiom-end/><note>Literally “fathers”</note> for mighty warriors of strength <supplied>was</supplied> two thousand six hundred. <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:13">13</verse-number>And under their hand <supplied>were</supplied> army troops <supplied>numbering</supplied> three hundred and seven thousand five hundred who could make war with power and strength to help the king against an enemy. <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:14">14</verse-number>And Uzziah prepared small shields, spears, helmets, breastplates, bows, and slingstones for the whole army. <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:15">15</verse-number>And he made siege machines in Jerusalem designed <supplied>by</supplied> skillful men to be <supplied>set</supplied> upon the towers and upon the corners to shoot arrows and large slingstones. And his fame<note>Or “name”</note> went out far, for he helped marvelously, for he was strong. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ch 26:16">16</verse-number>But on account of his strength his heart grew proud unto destruction. And he acted unfaithfully against Yahweh his God and went into the temple of Yahweh to offer an incense offering on the altar. <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:17">17</verse-number>And Azariah the priest, along with eighty strong priests with him, went in after him. <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:18">18</verse-number>And they stood against King Uzziah and said to him, “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Yahweh, but <supplied>it is</supplied> for the priests, the descendants<note>Or “sons”</note> of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary, for you have acted unfaithfully. There will be no honor for you from Yahweh God.” <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:19">19</verse-number>Then Uzziah, his censer in hand to burn incense, became angry. And when he became angry with the priests, then leprosy appeared on his forehead in front of the priests in the house of Yahweh at the altar of incense. <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:20">20</verse-number>When Azariah the chief priest and all the priests turned to him, behold, he <supplied>was</supplied> leprous in the forehead. So they rushed him away from there, and he also hastened to go out, for Yahweh had smitten him. <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:21">21</verse-number>So King Uzziah was leprous until the day of his death, and he lived in a separate house as a leper, for he was cut off from the house of Yahweh. And Jotham his son <supplied>was</supplied> over the house of the king, judging the people of the land. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ch 26:22">22</verse-number>Now the remainder of the words of Uzziah, <supplied>from</supplied> the first <supplied>to</supplied> the last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, wrote <supplied>them</supplied>. <verse-number id="2 Ch 26:23">23</verse-number>And Uzziah slept with his ancestors,<note>Or “fathers”</note> and they buried him with his ancestors<note>Or “fathers”</note> in the burial field which belonged to the kings, because, they said, “He <supplied>was</supplied> leprous.” And Jotham his son reigned in his place. </p>
