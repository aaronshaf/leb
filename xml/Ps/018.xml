				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:title">title</verse-number>For the <supplied>music</supplied> director. Of David, the servant of Yahweh, </li1>
				<li1>who spoke to Yahweh the words of this song </li1>
				<li1><idiom-start/>when<idiom-end/><note>Literally “on the day”</note> Yahweh delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, </li1>
				<li1>and from the hand of Saul.<note>The Hebrew Bible counts the superscription as the first verse of the psalm; the English verse number is reduced by one</note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:1">1</verse-number>And he said: </li1>
				<li1>“I love you, O Yahweh, my strength.” </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:2">2</verse-number>Yahweh <supplied>is</supplied> my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, </li1>
				<li1>my God, my rock in whom I have taken refuge, </li1>
				<li1>my shield and the horn of my deliverance, my stronghold. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:3">3</verse-number>I called upon Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised, </li1>
				<li1>and I was saved from my enemies. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:4">4</verse-number>The ropes of death encircled me, </li1>
				<li1>and streams of ruin overwhelmed me. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:5">5</verse-number>The ropes of Sheol surrounded me; </li1>
				<li1><supplied>the</supplied> snares of death confronted me. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:6">6</verse-number>In my trouble I called on Yahweh, </li1>
				<li1>and to my God I cried for help. </li1>
				<li1>He heard my voice from his temple, </li1>
				<li1>and my cry for help </li1>
				<li1>came up before his presence into his ears. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:7">7</verse-number>Then the earth shook and quaked, </li1>
				<li1>and <supplied>the</supplied> foundations of <supplied>the</supplied> mountains trembled, </li1>
				<li1>and they staggered because he was angry. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:8">8</verse-number>Smoke went forth from his nose, </li1>
				<li1>and fire from his mouth consumed. </li1>
				<li1>Burning coals blazed from him. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:9">9</verse-number>So he bowed <supplied>the</supplied> heavens and came down </li1>
				<li1>with a thick cloud under his feet. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:10">10</verse-number>And he mounted a cherub and flew, </li1>
				<li1>and he swooped down on wings of wind. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:11">11</verse-number>He made darkness his hiding place; </li1>
				<li1>all about him his covering </li1>
				<li1><supplied>was</supplied> a darkness of waters, <idiom-start/>thick clouds<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “clouds of clouds”</note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:12">12</verse-number>From the brightness before him </li1>
				<li1>his clouds passed over </li1>
				<li1><supplied>with</supplied> hail and coals of fire. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:13">13</verse-number>And Yahweh thundered from the heavens, </li1>
				<li1>and the Most High uttered his voice </li1>
				<li1><supplied>with</supplied> hail and coals of fire. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:14">14</verse-number>And he shot his arrows and scattered them,<note>That is, the enemy</note> </li1>
				<li1>and many lightning bolts and routed them. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:15">15</verse-number>Then the channels of <supplied>the</supplied> sea became visible, </li1>
				<li1>and <supplied>the</supplied> foundations of <supplied>the</supplied> world were uncovered </li1>
				<li1>by your rebuke, O Yahweh, </li1>
				<li1>by the <idiom-start/>blast<idiom-end/><note>Or “breath”</note> of the wind of your nose. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:16">16</verse-number>He reached<note>Or “sent”</note> from on high; he seized me. </li1>
				<li1>He drew me from many waters. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:17">17</verse-number>He delivered me from my strong enemy, </li1>
				<li1>and from <supplied>those who</supplied> hated me </li1>
				<li1>because they were stronger than I. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:18">18</verse-number>They confronted me on the day of disaster, </li1>
				<li1>but Yahweh was my support. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:19">19</verse-number>So he brought me out to a spacious place. </li1>
				<li1>He delivered me because he delighted in me. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:20">20</verse-number>Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness; </li1>
				<li1>According to the cleanness of my hands </li1>
				<li1>he has repaid me. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:21">21</verse-number>Because I have kept the ways of Yahweh, </li1>
				<li1>and have not acted wickedly against my God, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:22">22</verse-number>because all his ordinances <supplied>are</supplied> before me, </li1>
				<li1>and his statutes I have not removed from me, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:23">23</verse-number>and I was blameless before him, </li1>
				<li1>and I kept myself from my guilt. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:24">24</verse-number>Therefore Yahweh has repaid me according to my righteousness, </li1>
				<li1>according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:25">25</verse-number>To <supplied>the</supplied> loyal you show yourself loyal. </li1>
				<li1>To <supplied>the</supplied> blameless you show yourself blameless. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:26">26</verse-number>To <supplied>the</supplied> pure you show yourself pure. </li1>
				<li1>but to <supplied>the</supplied> wicked you show yourself shrewd. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:27">27</verse-number>For you deliver humble people, </li1>
				<li1>but haughty eyes you humiliate. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:28">28</verse-number>For you light my lamp; </li1>
				<li1>Yahweh, my God, lights up my darkness. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:29">29</verse-number>For with you I can charge a troop, </li1>
				<li1>and with my God I can scale a wall. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:30">30</verse-number>This<note>Hebrew “The”</note> God—his way <supplied>is</supplied> blameless. </li1>
				<li1>The word of Yahweh <supplied>is</supplied> flawless.<note>Or “refined”</note> </li1>
				<li1>He <supplied>is</supplied> a shield for all those who take refuge in him. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:31">31</verse-number>For who <supplied>is</supplied> God apart from Yahweh, </li1>

				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:32">32</verse-number>The God who girded me <supplied>with</supplied> strength, </li1>
				<li1>and made safe<note>Or “blameless”</note> my way, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:33">33</verse-number>he made my feet like the deer’s, </li1>
				<li1>and on my high places he makes me stand. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:34">34</verse-number><supplied>He</supplied> trains my hands for war, </li1>
				<li1>so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:35">35</verse-number>You also gave me the shield of your salvation, </li1>
				<li1>and your right hand supported me, </li1>
				<li1>and your humility made me great. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:36">36</verse-number>You enlarged my step under me, </li1>
				<li1>and my ankles did not slip. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:37">37</verse-number>I chased my enemies and overtook them; </li1>
				<li1>I did not turn back until they were finished <supplied>off</supplied>. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:38">38</verse-number>I struck them and they were not able to stand up; </li1>
				<li1>they fell under my feet. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:39">39</verse-number>And you girded me <supplied>with</supplied> strength for the battle; </li1>
				<li1><supplied>those</supplied> rising against me you made to kneel under me. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:40">40</verse-number>And you <idiom-start/>made my enemies turn their backs<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “turned to me my enemies’ neck”</note> </li1>
				<li1>then I destroyed those <supplied>who</supplied> hated me. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:41">41</verse-number>They cried out but there was no rescuer, </li1>
				<li1><supplied>even</supplied> to Yahweh, but he did not answer them. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:42">42</verse-number>And I ground them like dust <idiom-start/>in the wind<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “on <supplied>the</supplied> face of <supplied>the</supplied> wind”</note> </li1>
				<li1>I emptied them<note>Many Hebrew manuscripts, the LXX, Syriac, and <cite title="BibleLEB2: 2 Sa 22:43">2 Sam 22:43 </cite>read “I crushed them”</note> out like mud of <supplied>the</supplied> streets. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:43">43</verse-number>You rescued me from strife with people; </li1>
				<li1>you set me as head (over) nations. </li1>
				<li1>People I did not know served me; </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:44">44</verse-number>as soon as <idiom-start/>they heard<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “hearing of ear”</note> they obeyed me. </li1>
				<li1><supplied>The</supplied> children of a foreign land feigned obedience before me. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:45">45</verse-number><supplied>The</supplied> children of a foreign land <idiom-start/>lost heart<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “sunk down”</note> </li1>
				<li1>and they came trembling from their strongholds. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:46">46</verse-number>Yahweh lives, and blessed <supplied>be</supplied> my rock, </li1>
				<li1>and may the God of my salvation be exalted— </li1>

				<li1>and subdued peoples under me, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 18:48">48</verse-number>who delivered me from my enemies. </li1>
				<li1>Indeed, you exalted me higher than <supplied>those who</supplied> rose against me. </li1>
