				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 1:1">1</verse-number>Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of <supplied>the</supplied> wicked; </li1>
				<li1>nor does he stand in <supplied>the</supplied> way of sinners; </li1>
				<li1>nor does he sit in <supplied>the</supplied> assembly of mockers. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 1:2">2</verse-number>Instead, in the law of Yahweh <supplied>is</supplied> his delight, </li1>
				<li1>and on his law he meditates day and night. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 1:3">3</verse-number>And so, he is like a tree planted by streams of water </li1>
				<li1>that gives its fruit in its season; </li1>
				<li1>its leaf also does not wither. </li1>
				<li1>Therefore all that he does prospers. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 1:4">4</verse-number>Not so the wicked. </li1>
				<li1>Instead, <supplied>they are</supplied> like the chaff that <supplied>the</supplied> wind scatters. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 1:5">5</verse-number>Therefore <supplied>the</supplied> wicked will not stand in the judgment, </li1>
				<li1>nor sinners in the congregation of <supplied>the</supplied> righteous; </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 1:6">6</verse-number>for Yahweh knows <supplied>the</supplied> way of <supplied>the</supplied> righteous,<note>Plural</note> </li1>
				<li1>but <supplied>the</supplied> way of <supplied>the</supplied> wicked will perish. </li1>
