				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:1">1</verse-number>Praise Yah.<note>Hebrew <i>hallelujah</i></note> Give thanks to Yahweh, for <supplied>he is</supplied> good, </li1>
				<li1>for his loyal love <supplied>is</supplied> forever. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:2">2</verse-number>Who can utter the mighty deeds of Yahweh, </li1>
				<li1><supplied>or</supplied> proclaim all his praise? </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:3">3</verse-number>Blessed are <supplied>those who</supplied> observe justice, </li1>
				<li1><supplied>he who</supplied> does righteousness at all times. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:4">4</verse-number>Remember me, O Yahweh, when <supplied>you show</supplied> favor to your people. </li1>
				<li1>Look after me when you deliver, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:5">5</verse-number>that <supplied>I</supplied> may see the good <supplied>done</supplied> your chosen ones, </li1>
				<li1>to be glad in the joy of your nation, </li1>
				<li1>to glory together with your inheritance. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:6">6</verse-number>We have sinned <supplied>along</supplied> with our ancestors.<note>Or “fathers”</note> </li1>
				<li1>We have committed iniquity; we have incurred guilt. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:7">7</verse-number>Our ancestors<note>Or “fathers”</note> in Egypt did not understand your wonderful works. </li1>
				<li1>They did not remember your many acts of loyal love, </li1>
				<li1>and <supplied>so</supplied> they rebelled by <supplied>the</supplied> sea at <idiom-start/>the Red Sea<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “sea of reed”</note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:8">8</verse-number>Yet he saved them for the sake of his name, </li1>
				<li1>to make known his might. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:9">9</verse-number>So he rebuked <idiom-start/>the Red Sea<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “sea of reed”</note> and it dried up, </li1>
				<li1>and he led them through the deep as <supplied>through</supplied> a desert. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:10">10</verse-number>Thus he saved them from <supplied>the</supplied> hand of <supplied>the</supplied> hater </li1>
				<li1>and redeemed them from <supplied>the</supplied> hand of <supplied>the</supplied> enemy. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:11">11</verse-number>But waters covered their adversaries; </li1>
				<li1>not one of them survived. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:12">12</verse-number>Then they believed his words; </li1>
				<li1>they sang his praise. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:13">13</verse-number>They quickly forgot his works; </li1>
				<li1>they did not wait for his counsel. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:14">14</verse-number>And they <idiom-start/>craved intensely<idiom-end/><note>Literally “craved a craving”</note> in the wilderness, </li1>
				<li1>and tested God in <supplied>the</supplied> desert. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:15">15</verse-number>So he gave to them their request, </li1>
				<li1>but he sent leanness into their souls.<note>Hebrew “soul” or “inner self”</note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:16">16</verse-number>And they were jealous of Moses in the camp, </li1>
				<li1><supplied>and</supplied> of Aaron, the holy one of Yahweh. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:17">17</verse-number><supplied>The</supplied> earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, </li1>
				<li1>and it covered over the gang of Abiram. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:18">18</verse-number>Also fire burned in their assembly; </li1>
				<li1><supplied>the</supplied> flame devoured <supplied>the</supplied> wicked. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:19">19</verse-number>They made a calf at Horeb </li1>
				<li1>and bowed down to a cast image. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:20">20</verse-number>And <supplied>so</supplied> they exchanged their glory </li1>
				<li1>for an image of an ox that eats grass. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:21">21</verse-number>They forgot God their Savior, </li1>
				<li1>who had done great things in Egypt, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:22">22</verse-number>wonders in the land of Ham, </li1>
				<li1>awesome deeds by <idiom-start/>the Red Sea<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “sea of reed”</note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:23">23</verse-number>So he said he would exterminate them, </li1>
				<li1>had not Moses, his chosen one, </li1>
				<li1>stood in the breach before him, </li1>
				<li1>to reverse his wrath from destroying <supplied>them</supplied>. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:24">24</verse-number>Then they refused the desirable land; </li1>
				<li1>they did not believe his word, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:25">25</verse-number>but grumbled in their tents. </li1>
				<li1>They did not obey the voice of Yahweh. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:26">26</verse-number>So <idiom-start/>he made an oath<idiom-end/><note>Literally “he lifted his hand,” an act accompanying an oath</note> against them, </li1>
				<li1>to make them drop in the wilderness, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:27">27</verse-number>and to disperse<note>Or “let drop”</note> their <idiom-start/>descendants<idiom-end/><note>Literally “seed”</note> among the nations </li1>
				<li1>and to scatter them among the lands. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:28">28</verse-number>They also attached themselves to Baal of Peor, </li1>
				<li1>and they ate sacrifices offered to <supplied>the</supplied> dead.<note>Hebrew “sacrifices of dead”</note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:29">29</verse-number>Thus they provoked to anger by their deeds, </li1>
				<li1>and a plague broke out among them. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:30">30</verse-number>Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, </li1>
				<li1>and <supplied>so</supplied> the plague was stopped, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:31">31</verse-number>and it was reckoned to him as righteousness </li1>
				<li1><idiom-start/>throughout all generations<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “for a generation and a generation”</note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:32">32</verse-number>They also angered <supplied>God</supplied> at the waters of Meribah, </li1>
				<li1>and it went badly for Moses on account of them, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:33">33</verse-number>because they rebelled against his Spirit,<note>A slightly different verbal form yields “they embittered his spirit”</note> </li1>
				<li1>and he spoke thoughtlessly with his lips. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:34">34</verse-number>They did not exterminate the peoples, </li1>
				<li1>as Yahweh had commanded them, <note>Hebrew “said to them”</note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:35">35</verse-number>but they mingled with the nations </li1>
				<li1>and learned their works, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:36">36</verse-number>and served their idols, </li1>
				<li1>which became<note>Hebrew “and they became”</note> a snare to them. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:37">37</verse-number>They even sacrificed their sons and daughters </li1>
				<li1>to the demons, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:38">38</verse-number>and they poured out innocent blood, </li1>
				<li1>the blood of their sons and daughters, </li1>
				<li1>whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, </li1>
				<li1>and <supplied>so</supplied> the land was defiled with the blood.<note>Hebrew “bloods,” that is, bloodshed</note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:39">39</verse-number>And they became unclean by their works, </li1>
				<li1>and were unfaithful in their deeds. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:40">40</verse-number>So Yahweh’s anger burned against his people, </li1>
				<li1>and he abhorred his inheritance. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:41">41</verse-number>Then he gave them into <supplied>the</supplied> hand of <supplied>the</supplied> nations, </li1>
				<li1>and those who hated them ruled over them. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:42">42</verse-number>And their enemies oppressed them, </li1>
				<li1>and they were subdued under their hand. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:43">43</verse-number>Many times he delivered them, </li1>
				<li1>but they rebelled in their counsel, </li1>
				<li1>and were brought low by their iniquity. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:44">44</verse-number>Yet he looked upon their distress </li1>
				<li1>when he heard their cry. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:45">45</verse-number>And he remembered his covenant with them, </li1>
				<li1>and relented based on the abundance of his loyal love. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:46">46</verse-number>And he <idiom-start/>let them find compassion<idiom-end/><note>Literally “gave them to <supplied>have</supplied> mercies”</note> </li1>
				<li1>before all their captors. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 106:47">47</verse-number>Save us, O Yahweh our God, </li1>
				<li1>and gather us from the nations, </li1>
				<li1>so that <supplied>we may</supplied> give thanks to your holy name </li1>
