				<li1>I have come to watery depths, </li1>

				<li1>and a foreigner to my mother’s sons, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 69:9">9</verse-number>because the zeal for your house<note>Or “temple”</note> has consumed me, </li1>
				<li1>and the reproaches of those reproaching you have fallen on me. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 69:10">10</verse-number>When I wept in the fasting of my soul, </li1>

				<li1>or the pit close its mouth over me. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 69:16">16</verse-number>Answer me, O Yahweh, because your loyal love <supplied>is</supplied> good; </li1>
				<li1>according to your abundant mercies, turn to me, </li1>

				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 69:21">21</verse-number>They also gave me gall for food,<note>Or “they put poison in my food”</note> </li1>
				<li1>and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 69:22">22</verse-number>Let their table before them be a trap, </li1>

				<li1>Let none dwell in their tents, </li1>
