				<li1>from east and from west, from north and from south.<note>Hebrew “sea” (<i>yam</i>), which usually means “west” in a listing of directions. The word “south” is expected (Hebrew <i>yamin</i>). Either the MT was corrupted early (along with <cite title="BibleLEB2: Is 49:12">Isa 49:12; </cite>the LXX reads “sea” in both) or it looks to the bodies of waters to the south (see also the Targum)</note> </li1>

				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 107:10">10</verse-number><supplied>Those who</supplied> sat in darkness and gloom, </li1>
				<li1>prisoners of misery and iron— </li1>

				<li1>and cuts through <supplied>the</supplied> bars of iron. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 107:17">17</verse-number>Fools, because of their rebellious way </li1>
