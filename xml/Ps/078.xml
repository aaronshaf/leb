				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:title">title</verse-number>A maskil of Asaph.<note>The Hebrew Bible counts the superscription as the first verse of the psalm</note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:1">1</verse-number>Listen, O my people, to my teaching. </li1>
				<li1>Incline your ears to the words of my mouth. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:2">2</verse-number>I will offer<note>Hebrew “open”</note> a parable <supplied>with</supplied> my mouth. </li1>
				<li1>I will pour out riddles from long ago, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:3">3</verse-number>that we have heard and known, </li1>
				<li1>and our ancestors<note>Or “fathers”</note> have told us. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:4">4</verse-number>We will not hide <supplied>them</supplied> from their children,<note>Or “descendants”</note> </li1>
				<li1>telling the next generation the praises of Yahweh, </li1>
				<li1>and his power and his wonders that he has done. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:5">5</verse-number>For he established a testimony in Jacob, </li1>
				<li1>and appointed a law<note>Hebrew <i>torah</i></note> in Israel, </li1>
				<li1>which he commanded our ancestors<note>Or “fathers”</note> </li1>
				<li1>to teach to their children, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:6">6</verse-number>so that <supplied>the</supplied> next generation might know— </li1>
				<li1>children <supplied>yet to</supplied> be born— </li1>
				<li1><supplied>that</supplied> they might rise up and tell their children, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:7">7</verse-number>that they might set their confidence in God, </li1>
				<li1>and not forget the deeds of God, </li1>
				<li1>but keep his commandments, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:8">8</verse-number>and not be like their ancestors,<note>Or “fathers”</note> </li1>
				<li1>a stubborn and rebellious generation, </li1>
				<li1>a generation <supplied>that</supplied> did not make ready its heart, </li1>
				<li1>whose spirit was not faithful <supplied>to</supplied> God. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:9">9</verse-number>The sons of Ephraim, <idiom-start/>armed with archers<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “armed with shooters of the bow”</note> </li1>
				<li1>turned back on <supplied>the</supplied> day of battle. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:10">10</verse-number>They did not keep the covenant of God </li1>
				<li1>and refused to go in his law.<note>Hebrew <i>torah</i></note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:11">11</verse-number>They also forgot his deeds, </li1>
				<li1>and his wonders that he had shown them. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:12">12</verse-number>In front of their ancestors<note>Or “fathers”</note> he did a wonder, </li1>
				<li1>in the land of Egypt, <supplied>in</supplied> the region of Zoan. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:13">13</verse-number>He split the sea and caused them to go over, </li1>
				<li1>and he caused waters to stand like a heap. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:14">14</verse-number>And he led them with the cloud by day, </li1>
				<li1>and all night with a fiery light. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:15">15</verse-number>He caused rocks to split in the wilderness </li1>
				<li1>and provided drink abundantly as <supplied>from the</supplied> depths. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:16">16</verse-number>And he brought streams out of <supplied>the</supplied> rock </li1>
				<li1>and caused water to flow down like rivers. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:17">17</verse-number>But they sinned still further against him </li1>
				<li1>by rebelling <supplied>against the</supplied> Most High in the desert. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:18">18</verse-number>And they tested God in their heart </li1>
				<li1><supplied>by</supplied> asking food <idiom-start/>for their craving<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “for their soul”</note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:19">19</verse-number>And they spoke against God. </li1>
				<li1>They said, “Is God able </li1>
				<li1>to prepare a table in the wilderness? </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:20">20</verse-number>Yes, he struck <supplied>the</supplied> rock and water flowed </li1>
				<li1>and streams gushed out, </li1>
				<li1><supplied>but</supplied> can he also give food </li1>
				<li1>or provide meat for his people?” </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:21">21</verse-number>Therefore Yahweh heard </li1>
				<li1>and he was very angry, </li1>
				<li1>and a fire was kindled against Jacob, </li1>
				<li1>and <supplied>his</supplied> anger also rose up against Israel, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:22">22</verse-number>because they did not believe God, </li1>
				<li1>and they did not trust his salvation. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:23">23</verse-number>Nevertheless, he commanded <supplied>the</supplied> skies above </li1>
				<li1>and opened <supplied>the</supplied> doors of heaven, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:24">24</verse-number>and rained down on them manna to eat </li1>
				<li1>and gave them the grain of heaven. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:25">25</verse-number>Humankind ate <supplied>the</supplied> bread of <idiom-start/>angels<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “mighty ones”</note> </li1>
				<li1>He sent them food <supplied>enough</supplied> to be satisfied. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:26">26</verse-number>He caused <supplied>the</supplied> east wind to blow in the heavens </li1>
				<li1>and drove along <supplied>the</supplied> south wind by his strength. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:27">27</verse-number>Then he rained meat on them like dust, </li1>
				<li1>even winged birds<note>Hebrew “bird”</note> like <supplied>the</supplied> sand of <supplied>the</supplied> seas. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:28">28</verse-number>He caused <supplied>them</supplied> to fall in the midst of his camp, </li1>
				<li1>all around his dwellings. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:29">29</verse-number>So they ate and were well filled, </li1>
				<li1>and he brought about <supplied>what</supplied> they craved. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:30">30</verse-number>They had not yet turned aside from their craving, </li1>
				<li1><supplied>while</supplied> their food <supplied>was</supplied> still in their mouth, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:31">31</verse-number>the anger of God rose against them, </li1>
				<li1>and he killed some of the stoutest of them, </li1>
				<li1>even the young men of Israel he caused to bow down <supplied>in death</supplied>. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:32">32</verse-number>In spite of all this they sinned further </li1>
				<li1>and did not believe his wonders. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:33">33</verse-number>And he consumed their days with futility <note>Or “he ended their days like a breath”</note> </li1>
				<li1>their years with terror.<note>Or “and their years suddenly”</note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:34">34</verse-number>When he killed <supplied>some of</supplied> them, then they sought him, </li1>
				<li1>and repented and earnestly sought God. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:35">35</verse-number>And they remembered that God <supplied>was</supplied> their rock, </li1>
				<li1>and God Most High their redeemer. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:36">36</verse-number>But they enticed him with their mouth </li1>
				<li1>and lied to him with their tongue. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:37">37</verse-number>For their heart was not steadfast with him, </li1>
				<li1>nor were they faithful to his covenant. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:38">38</verse-number>But he <supplied>was</supplied> compassionate; he pardoned<note>Or “covered,” or “atoned for”</note> <supplied>their</supplied> guilt </li1>
				<li1>and did not destroy <supplied>them</supplied>. </li1>
				<li1>And many <supplied>times</supplied> he turned back his anger </li1>
				<li1>and did not stir up all his wrath, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:39">39</verse-number>for he remembered that they <supplied>were</supplied> flesh, </li1>
				<li1>a passing wind that does not return. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:40">40</verse-number>How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness </li1>
				<li1>and vexed him in <supplied>the</supplied> wasteland! </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:41">41</verse-number>So they again tested God </li1>
				<li1>and distressed<note>Or perhaps, “pressed to the limit”</note> the Holy One of Israel. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:42">42</verse-number>And they did not remember his <idiom-start/>power<idiom-end/><note>Literally “hand”</note> </li1>
				<li1><idiom-start/>when<idiom-end/><note>Literally “the day that”</note> he redeemed them from the enemy, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:43">43</verse-number>how he performed<note>Hebrew “set”</note> his signs in Egypt </li1>
				<li1>and his wonders in the region of Zoan, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:44">44</verse-number>when he turned their rivers<note>Normally the word for the Nile, with the plural here suggesting perhaps it and its canals</note> to blood </li1>
				<li1>so they could not drink <supplied>from</supplied> their streams. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:45">45</verse-number>He sent among them flies that devoured them </li1>
				<li1>and frogs that destroyed them. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:46">46</verse-number>And he gave their crop to the locusts </li1>
				<li1>and their labor to the locust.<note>Two different words translated “locusts”</note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:47">47</verse-number>He destroyed their vines with hail </li1>
				<li1>and their sycamore trees with sleet.<note>The word for “sleet” is only used here, and the translation is a guess based on context</note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:48">48</verse-number>He also handed their cattle over to the hail </li1>
				<li1>and their livestock to the lightning bolts. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:49">49</verse-number>He sent against them his fierce anger, </li1>
				<li1>rage and indignation and trouble, </li1>
				<li1>a band of <idiom-start/>destroying<idiom-end/><note>Literally “evil”</note> angels. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:50">50</verse-number>He cleared a path for his anger. </li1>
				<li1>He did not spare them<note>Hebrew “their soul”</note> from death </li1>
				<li1>but handed their life over to the plague. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:51">51</verse-number>And he struck down all <supplied>the</supplied> firstborn in Egypt, </li1>
				<li1><supplied>the</supplied> first of <supplied>their</supplied> virility in the tents of Ham. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:52">52</verse-number>Then he led out his people like sheep </li1>
				<li1>and guided them like a herd in the wilderness. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:53">53</verse-number>And he led them safely and they were not afraid, </li1>
				<li1>but the sea covered their enemies. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:54">54</verse-number>So he brought them to his holy territory,<note>Hebrew “border”</note> </li1>
				<li1>this mountain his right hand acquired.<note>Or “had created”</note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:55">55</verse-number>And he drove out nations before them </li1>
				<li1>and allocated them for an inheritance by <supplied>boundary</supplied> line, </li1>
				<li1>and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:56">56</verse-number>But they tested and rebelled against God Most High </li1>
				<li1>and did not keep his statutes. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:57">57</verse-number>And they turned and were treacherous like their ancestors.<note>Or “fathers”</note> </li1>
				<li1>They twisted like a crooked<note>Or “deceitful”</note> bow. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:58">58</verse-number>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, </li1>
				<li1>and made him jealous with their images. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:59">59</verse-number>God heard and he was very angry </li1>
				<li1>and rejected Israel utterly. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:60">60</verse-number>So he abandoned the dwelling place at Shiloh, </li1>
				<li1><supplied>the</supplied> tent he had placed among humankind. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:61">61</verse-number>And he gave his strength into captivity </li1>
				<li1>and his splendor into <supplied>the</supplied> hand of <supplied>the</supplied> enemy. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:62">62</verse-number>He also handed his people over to the sword, </li1>
				<li1>and he was very angry with his inheritance. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:63">63</verse-number>Fire devoured his young men, </li1>
				<li1>and his young women<note>Or “virgins”</note> were not praised. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:64">64</verse-number>His priests fell by the sword, </li1>
				<li1>and his widows did not weep. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:65">65</verse-number>Then the Lord awoke like <supplied>one who had been</supplied> asleep, </li1>
				<li1><supplied>awoke</supplied> like a warrior who had been drunk with wine.<note>Or “like a warrior shouting because of wine”</note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:66">66</verse-number>And he beat back his enemies; </li1>
				<li1>he gave them over to perpetual scorn. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:67">67</verse-number>And he rejected the tent of Joseph, </li1>
				<li1>and did not chose the tribe of Ephraim, </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:68">68</verse-number>but chose the tribe of Judah, </li1>
				<li1><idiom-start/>Mount Zion<idiom-end/><note>Literally “the mountain of Zion”</note> that he loved. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:69">69</verse-number>And he built his sanctuary like <supplied>the</supplied> heights, </li1>
				<li1>like <supplied>the</supplied> earth that he established forever. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:70">70</verse-number>And he chose David his servant </li1>
				<li1>and took him from <supplied>the</supplied> sheepfolds. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:71">71</verse-number>He brought him from following nursing ewes </li1>
				<li1>to shepherd Jacob, his people, </li1>
				<li1>and Israel, his inheritance. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ps 78:72">72</verse-number>And he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, </li1>
				<li1>and led them by the skillfulness of his hands. </li1>
