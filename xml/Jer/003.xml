				<li2>will he return to her again?’ </li2>
				<li1>Will not that land be greatly defiled? </li1>
				<li1>And you have prostituted <supplied>yourself</supplied> <supplied>with</supplied> many lovers, </li1>

			<pericope>Yahweh Gives Israel a Letter of Divorce</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Je 3:6">6</verse-number>Then Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah, the king, “Have you seen what apostate<note>Or “unfaithful”</note> Israel has done? She has gone on every high hill and under every leafy tree and she has prostituted <supplied>herself</supplied> there. <verse-number id="Je 3:7">7</verse-number>And I thought, ‘After her doing all these <supplied>things</supplied> to me she will return,’ but she did not return. And her treacherous sister Judah saw <supplied>it</supplied>.<note>Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> <verse-number id="Je 3:8">8</verse-number>And I saw that <idiom-start/>for this very reason, that<idiom-end/><note>Literally “because of all”</note> on account of apostate<note>Or “unfaithful”</note> Israel committing adultery I divorced her and gave the letter of divorce to her. Yet her treacherous sister Judah was not afraid and she went and prostituted <supplied>herself</supplied> also. <verse-number id="Je 3:9">9</verse-number>And it was because of the frivolity of her fornication that she defiled the land and committed adultery with the stone and with the tree. <verse-number id="Je 3:10">10</verse-number>Yet even in all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, <idiom-start/>but only<idiom-end/><note>Literally “but if”</note> in pretense,”<note>Or “deception”</note> <idiom-start/>declares<idiom-end/><note>Literally “a declaration of”</note> Yahweh. </p>

			<pericope>A Call for Repentance</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Je 3:11">11</verse-number>Then Yahweh said to me, “Apostate<note>Or “unfaithful”</note> Israel has proved herself more upright<note>Or “righteous”</note> than treacherous Judah. <verse-number id="Je 3:12">12</verse-number>Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>‘Return, apostate<note>Or “unfaithful”</note> Israel,’ <idiom-start/>declares<idiom-end/><note>Literally “a declaration of”</note> Yahweh. </li1>

				<li1><verse-number id="Je 3:13">13</verse-number>Only acknowledge your guilt, </li1>
				<li1>that against Yahweh your God you have rebelled, </li1>
				<li1>and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every leafy tree, </li1>
				<li1>and you have not obeyed my voice,’ <idiom-start/>declares<idiom-end/><note>Literally “a declaration of”</note> Yahweh.” </li1>

			<p><verse-number id="Je 3:14">14</verse-number>“Return, apostate<note>Or “unfaithful”</note> children,” <idiom-start/>declares<idiom-end/><note>Literally “a declaration of”</note> Yahweh. “For <idiom-start/>I am your master<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “I rule over among you”</note> and I will take you one from a city and two from a clan,<note>Or “family”</note> and I will bring you <supplied>to</supplied> Zion. <verse-number id="Je 3:15">15</verse-number>Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart and they will feed you knowledge and insight. <verse-number id="Je 3:16">16</verse-number>And it will be when you have multiplied and become fruitful in the land in those days,” <idiom-start/>declares<idiom-end/><note>Literally “a declaration of”</note> Yahweh, “they will no longer say, ‘The ark of the covenant of Yahweh.’ And <idiom-start/>it will not come to mind<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “it shall not go up on heart”</note> nor will they remember it, nor will they miss <supplied>it</supplied>,<note>Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> nor will it be made again. <verse-number id="Je 3:17">17</verse-number>At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘The Throne of Yahweh,’ and all the nations will be gathered to it, to the name of Yahweh, to Jerusalem, and they will no longer go after the stubbornness of their evil heart. <verse-number id="Je 3:18">18</verse-number>In those days the house of Judah will walk along with the house of Israel and they will come together from <supplied>the</supplied> land of <supplied>the</supplied> north to the land that I gave as an inheritance <supplied>to</supplied> your ancestors.<note>Or “fathers”</note> </p>

			<ul>
				<li1><verse-number id="Je 3:19">19</verse-number>Then I thought, ‘How I would set you among the children, </li1>
				<li2>and I would give you a land of desire, </li2>
				<li1>an inheritance of <supplied>the</supplied> glory of <supplied>the</supplied> hosts of nations.’ </li1>
				<li1>And I thought, ‘You would call me, “My father,” </li1>
				<li2>and you would not turn back from <idiom-start/>behind<idiom-end/><note>Or “following”</note> me.’ </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Je 3:20">20</verse-number>However, as a wife departs treacherously from her lover, </li1>
				<li2>so you have dealt treacherously with me, </li2>
				<li1><supplied>O</supplied> house of Israel,” <idiom-start/>declares<idiom-end/><note>Literally “a declaration of”</note> Yahweh. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Je 3:21">21</verse-number>“A voice <supplied>is</supplied> heard on <supplied>the</supplied> barren heights, </li1>
				<li2>the weeping of the pleas for mercy of the children of Israel, </li2>
				<li1>because they have perverted their way, </li1>
				<li2>they have forgotten Yahweh their God. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Je 3:22">22</verse-number>Return, <supplied>O</supplied> apostate<note>Or “unfaithful”</note> children, </li1>
				<li2>I will heal your backsliding. </li2>
				<li1>‘Look, we come to you, </li1>

				<li1>Surely, in Yahweh our God </li1>
				<li2><supplied>is</supplied> the salvation of Israel. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Je 3:24">24</verse-number>But the shameful thing has devoured </li1>
				<li2>the labor of our ancestors<note>Or “fathers”</note> from our youth, </li2>
				<li1>their flocks, and their cattle, </li1>
				<li2>their sons and their daughters. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Je 3:25">25</verse-number>Let us lie down in our shame, </li1>
				<li2>and let our disgrace cover us. </li2>
				<li1>For against Yahweh our God we have sinned, </li1>
				<li2>we and our ancestors,<note>Or “fathers”</note> </li2>
				<li1>from our youth and until this day. </li1>
				<li2>and we have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God.’ </li2>
