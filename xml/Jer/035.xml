			<p><verse-number id="Je 35:5">5</verse-number>Then I <idiom-start/>set<idiom-end/><note>Literally “gave”</note> <idiom-start/>before<idiom-end/><note>Literally “to the face of”</note> the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine and cups, and I said to them, “Drink wine.” <verse-number id="Je 35:6">6</verse-number>But they answered, “We will not drink wine, for Jonadab, the son of Rechab, our ancestor,<note>Or “father”</note> commanded us, <idiom-start/>saying<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “to say”</note> ‘You shall not drink wine, you or your children, <idiom-start/>forever<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “until eternity”</note> <verse-number id="Je 35:7">7</verse-number>And you shall not build a house, and you shall not sow seed, and you shall not plant a vineyard, and it shall not be for you, but in tents you shall live all your days, so that you may live many days on the surface of the land where you <supplied>are</supplied> dwelling as aliens.’ <verse-number id="Je 35:8">8</verse-number>And we obeyed the voice of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, our ancestor,<note>Or “father”</note> in all that he commanded us, not to drink wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters, <verse-number id="Je 35:9">9</verse-number>and not to build houses <supplied>for</supplied> our living, and there is not vineyard, or field, or seed for us. <verse-number id="Je 35:10">10</verse-number>But we have lived in tents, and we have obeyed, and we have done all that Jehonadab, our ancestor,<note>Or “father”</note> commanded us. <verse-number id="Je 35:11">11</verse-number><idiom-start/>But then<idiom-end/><note>Literally “And it was”</note> at the coming up against the land of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, then we said, ‘Come and let us go <supplied>to</supplied> Jerusalem <idiom-start/>before<idiom-end/><note>“from the face of”</note> the army of the Chaldeans, and <idiom-start/>before<idiom-end/><note>“from the face of”</note> the army of the Arameans.’<note>Hebrew “Aramean”</note> That is why we are living in Jerusalem.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Je 35:12">12</verse-number>And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, <idiom-start/>saying<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “to say”</note> <verse-number id="Je 35:13">13</verse-number>“Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Go and say to the people of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Can you not learn a lesson to listen to my words?” <idiom-start/>declares<idiom-end/><note>Literally “a declaration of”</note> Yahweh. <verse-number id="Je 35:14">14</verse-number>“The words of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, that he commanded his descendants<note>Or “children”</note> to not drink, have been carried out, and they have not drunk until this day, for they have obeyed the command of their ancestor.<note>Or “father”</note> But <idiom-start/>I have spoken to you over and over again<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “I have spoken to you doing early and speaking”</note> and you have not listened to me. <verse-number id="Je 35:15">15</verse-number>And I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, <idiom-start/>I have sent them over and over again<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “doing early and sending”</note> <idiom-start/>saying<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “to say”</note> ‘Turn back please each one from his evil way, and amend your deeds, and you must not go after other gods to serve them, <idiom-start/>so that you may live<idiom-end/><note>Literally “and live”</note> on the land that I gave to you and to your ancestors.’<note>Or “fathers”</note> But you did not incline your ear and you did not listen to me. <verse-number id="Je 35:16">16</verse-number>For the descendants<note>Or “children”</note> of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, have carried out the command of their ancestor<note>Or “father”</note> that he commanded them, but this people did not listen to me.” </p>
