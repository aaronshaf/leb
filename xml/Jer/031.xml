				<li1>“I will be the God of all the clans<note>Or “families”</note> of Israel, </li1>

				<li1>“<supplied>The</supplied> people of <supplied>the</supplied> survivors of the sword found grace in the desert;<note>Or “wilderness”</note> </li1>

				<li1><verse-number id="Je 31:3">3</verse-number>From afar Yahweh appeared to me, <supplied>saying</supplied>, </li1>
				<li1>“I have loved you <supplied>with</supplied> an everlasting love. </li1>

				<li1><verse-number id="Je 31:4">4</verse-number>I will again build you, </li1>
				<li2>and you will be built, O virgin Israel. </li2>
				<li1>You will again adorn yourself <supplied>with</supplied> your tambourines, </li1>
				<li2>and you will go forth in <supplied>the</supplied> dancing in a ring of <supplied>the</supplied> merrymakers. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Je 31:5">5</verse-number>You will again plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria. </li1>

				<li1><verse-number id="Je 31:6">6</verse-number>For there will be a day <supplied>when</supplied> watchmen will call in the hill country of Ephraim, </li1>

			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p><verse-number id="Je 31:7">7</verse-number>For thus says Yahweh, </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>“Sing for joy for Jacob <supplied>with</supplied> gladness, </li1>
				<li2>and shout out for the head of the nations. </li2>
				<li1>Proclaim, praise, and say, </li1>

				<li1>Among them <supplied>the</supplied> blind, and <supplied>the</supplied> lame, </li1>
				<li2><supplied>those who are</supplied> pregnant, and <supplied>those who</supplied> give birth, </li2>
				<li1>together, a great assembly, </li1>
				<li2>they will return here. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Je 31:9">9</verse-number>With weeping they will come, </li1>
				<li2>and with pleas for mercy I will bring them; </li2>
				<li1>I will let them walk by streams of water in a straight path. </li1>
				<li2>They will not stumble in it, </li2>
				<li1>for I have become to Israel a father, </li1>
				<li2>and Ephraim, he <supplied>is</supplied> my firstborn.” </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Je 31:10">10</verse-number>Hear the word of Yahweh, <supplied>O</supplied> nations, </li1>
				<li2>and declare in the coastlands from afar, and say, </li2>
				<li1>“The scatterer of Israel will gather him, </li1>
				<li2>and he will keep him as a shepherd his flock. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Je 31:11">11</verse-number>For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob, </li1>

				<li2>and over <supplied>the</supplied> young ones of <supplied>the</supplied> flock, and over <supplied>the</supplied> cattle. </li2>
				<li1>And their life will become like a well-watered garden, </li1>
				<li2>and they will never languish again.” </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Je 31:13">13</verse-number>“Then <supplied>the</supplied> young woman will rejoice in <supplied>the</supplied> dancing in a ring, </li1>

				<li1><verse-number id="Je 31:15">15</verse-number>Thus says Yahweh, </li1>
				<li1>“A voice <supplied>is</supplied> heard in Ramah, </li1>
				<li2>lamentation, <supplied>the</supplied> weeping of bitterness. </li2>
				<li1>Rachel <supplied>is</supplied> weeping for her children; </li1>

			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p><verse-number id="Je 31:16">16</verse-number>Thus says Yahweh: </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>“Restrain your voice from weeping, </li1>
				<li2>and your eyes from tears, </li2>
				<li1>for there is a reward for your work,” <idiom-start/>declares<idiom-end/><note>Literally “a declaration of”</note> Yahweh, </li1>

				<li1><verse-number id="Je 31:17">17</verse-number>And there is hope for your future,” <idiom-start/>declares<idiom-end/><note>Literally “a declaration of”</note> Yahweh, </li1>
				<li2>“and <supplied>your</supplied> children will return to their territory. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Je 31:18">18</verse-number>Indeed I heard Ephraim pitying themselves, </li1>
				<li2>‘You disciplined me, and I was disciplined, </li2>
				<li2>like a calf that is not trained. </li2>
				<li1>Bring me back and let me return, </li1>
				<li2>for you <supplied>are</supplied> Yahweh my God. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Je 31:19">19</verse-number>For after my turning back I repented, </li1>
				<li2>and after coming to understand I struck <supplied>my</supplied> thigh. </li2>
				<li1>I was ashamed and also humiliated, </li1>
				<li2>because I bore the disgrace of my youth.’ </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Je 31:20">20</verse-number><supplied>Is</supplied> Ephraim my dear son, </li1>
				<li2>or <supplied>the</supplied> child of <supplied>my</supplied> delight? </li2>
				<li1>For <idiom-start/>as often as<idiom-end/><note>Literally “from enough”</note> I have earnestly spoken against him, </li1>
				<li2>I still remember him. </li2>
				<li1><idiom-start/>Therefore<idiom-end/><note>Literally “Unto thus”</note> my bowels are turbulent for him, </li1>
				<li2>surely I will have compassion on him,” <idiom-start/>declares<idiom-end/><note>Literally “a declaration of”</note> Yahweh. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Je 31:21">21</verse-number>“Set up for yourself road markers, </li1>

			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p><verse-number id="Je 31:23">23</verse-number>Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “They will again say these words<note>Hebrew “word”</note> in the land of Judah and in its towns at my restoring their fortunes,<note>Hebrew “fortune”</note> </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>‘Yahweh bless you, <supplied>O</supplied> settlement of righteousness, </li1>
