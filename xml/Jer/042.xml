			<p><verse-number id="Je 42:13">13</verse-number>But if you <supplied>are</supplied> saying, “We will not stay in this land,” <supplied>so as to</supplied> not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, <verse-number id="Je 42:14">14</verse-number>saying, “No, for we will go <supplied>to</supplied> the land of Egypt where we will not see war, and we will not hear <supplied>the</supplied> sound of a horn, and we will not be hungry for bread, and there we will stay,” <verse-number id="Je 42:15">15</verse-number>then <idiom-start/>therefore<idiom-end/><note>Literally “to thus”</note> hear the word of Yahweh, O remnant of Judah. Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “<idiom-start/>If you are determined<idiom-end/><note>Literally “If you indeed set your face”</note> to go <supplied>to</supplied> Egypt, and you go to dwell as aliens there, <verse-number id="Je 42:16">16</verse-number>then it will be <supplied>that</supplied> the sword that you <supplied>are</supplied> in fear of will overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine that you <supplied>are</supplied> anxious of will pursue after you there <supplied>into</supplied> Egypt, and there you will die. <verse-number id="Je 42:17">17</verse-number>So all the people who <idiom-start/>are determined<idiom-end/><note>Literally “have set their faces”</note> to go <supplied>to</supplied> Egypt to dwell as aliens there will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague, and there will not be for them an escapee or a survivor from the disaster that I <supplied>am</supplied> bringing upon them.” <verse-number id="Je 42:18">18</verse-number>For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “As my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will pour out on you at your going <supplied>to</supplied> Egypt, and you will become a curse, and a horror, and a curse <supplied>formula</supplied>, and a disgrace, and you will no longer see this place.” ’ </p>
