			<pericope>Resistance to Rebuilding the House of God</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Ezr 4:1">1</verse-number>Now the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the <idiom-start/>returned exiles<idiom-end/><note>Literally “the sons of the exile”</note> <supplied>were</supplied> building a temple for Yahweh the God of Israel. <verse-number id="Ezr 4:2">2</verse-number>And they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of the <idiom-start/>families<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “fathers”</note> and they said to them, “Let us build with you. Like you, we seek your God and have been sacrificing <supplied>to him</supplied> from the days of Esarhaddon the king of Assyria who brought us up here. <verse-number id="Ezr 4:3">3</verse-number>But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of the <idiom-start/>families<idiom-end/><note>Literally “fathers”</note> of Israel said to them, “<supplied>It is</supplied> not for you but for us to build a house for our God. For we ourselves alone will build <supplied>it</supplied> for Yahweh the God of Israel, just as Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Ezr 4:4">4</verse-number>Then the people of the land discouraged <idiom-start/>the people of Judah<idiom-end/><note>Literally “the hands of the people of Judah”</note> and made them afraid to build <verse-number id="Ezr 4:5">5</verse-number>and bribed officials against them to frustrate their plan for all the days of Cyrus king of Persia until the reign of Darius king of Persia. </p>

			<pericope>Resistance to Rebuilding Jerusalem</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Ezr 4:6">6</verse-number>In the reign of Ahasuerus, at the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. <verse-number id="Ezr 4:7">7</verse-number>And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their colleagues wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia. The letter was written in Aramaic and translated from Aramaic. <verse-number id="Ezr 4:8">8</verse-number>Rehum the royal officer and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes as follows <verse-number id="Ezr 4:9">9</verse-number>(then Rehum the royal officer, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates, the judges, the envoys, the officials, the Persians, the Erechs, the Babylonians, the Susians (that is the Elamites) <verse-number id="Ezr 4:10">10</verse-number>and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and the rest of <supplied>the province</supplied> Beyond the River) and now <verse-number id="Ezr 4:11">11</verse-number>this is the copy of the letter which they sent to him: </p>
			<p>“To King Artaxerxes <supplied>from</supplied> your servants, the men of <supplied>the province</supplied> Beyond the River. And now, <verse-number id="Ezr 4:12">12</verse-number>be it known to the king that the Jews who have come up from near you to us have gone to Jerusalem. They are building the rebellious and wicked city. They are finishing the wall and repairing the foundation. <verse-number id="Ezr 4:13">13</verse-number>Now be it known to the king that if this city is built and the walls are finished, they will not pay tribute and toll, and the royal revenue will be reduced. <verse-number id="Ezr 4:14">14</verse-number>Now since we eat the salt of the palace and the dishonor of the king is not proper for us to see, we send and make <supplied>this</supplied> known to the king, <verse-number id="Ezr 4:15">15</verse-number>so that it may be investigated in the book of records of your ancestors.<note>Or “fathers”</note> You will find in the book of records and learn that this city is a rebellious city, hurtful to kings and provinces, and they have rebelled in its midst from ancient times. Because of that this city was destroyed. <verse-number id="Ezr 4:16">16</verse-number>We make known to the king that if this city is built and the walls are finished, you will have nothing in <supplied>the province</supplied> Beyond the River.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Ezr 4:17">17</verse-number>The king sent a reply: “To Rehum the royal officer, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates who live in Samaria and the rest <supplied>of the province</supplied> Beyond the River, greetings. And now <verse-number id="Ezr 4:18">18</verse-number>the letter that you sent to us has been translated <supplied>and</supplied> read before me. <verse-number id="Ezr 4:19">19</verse-number>And <idiom-start/>I issued<idiom-end/><note>Literally “by my means made”</note> a decree, and they searched and found that this city from ancient days revolted against kings, and rebellion and sedition has been made in it. <verse-number id="Ezr 4:20">20</verse-number>Mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem, <supplied>governing</supplied> all <supplied>the province</supplied> Beyond the River, to whom tribute, duty, and tax has been given. <verse-number id="Ezr 4:21">21</verse-number>So now, issue forth a decree that these men stop and this city not be built, until a decree is issued from me. <verse-number id="Ezr 4:22">22</verse-number>And be careful not to be negligent on this matter. Why should damage grow to hurt kings?” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Ezr 4:23">23</verse-number>Then when a copy of the letter of King Artaxerxes was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their associates they returned in a hurry to Jerusalem against the Jews and they stopped them by force and power. <verse-number id="Ezr 4:24">24</verse-number>Then the work on the house of God in Jerusalem stopped, and was discontinued until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia. </p>
