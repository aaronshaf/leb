Peace. And now <verse-number id="Ezr 7:13">13</verse-number>I issue forth a decree that any of the people of Israel, their priests, or their Levites in my kingdom who are willing to go to Jerusalem may go with you. <verse-number id="Ezr 7:14">14</verse-number>For you are sent from the king and his seven counselors to enquire about Judah and Jerusalem concerning the law of your God, which is in your hand. <verse-number id="Ezr 7:15">15</verse-number>Also, bring the silver and gold that the king and his advisors have freely offered to the God of Israel whose dwelling is in Jerusalem, <verse-number id="Ezr 7:16">16</verse-number>and all of the silver and gold that you will find in the whole province of Babylonia, with the freewill offerings of the people and the priests giving willingly for the house of their God in Jerusalem. <verse-number id="Ezr 7:17">17</verse-number>With this money, then, with diligence you must buy young bulls, young rams, lambs, and their offerings and libations. You must offer them on the altar that is in the house of your God in Jerusalem. <verse-number id="Ezr 7:18">18</verse-number>You may do whatever seems best to you and your brothers to do with the remainder of the silver and gold according to the desire of your God. <verse-number id="Ezr 7:19">19</verse-number>And the vessels that were given to you for the service of the house of your God you shall deliver before the God of Jerusalem. <verse-number id="Ezr 7:20">20</verse-number>And the remainder of the needs for the house of your God that falls to you to provide, you may provide from the house of the king’s treasury.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Ezr 7:21">21</verse-number>“I, even I, King Artaxerxes, issue forth a decree to all the treasurers who are in <supplied>the province</supplied> Beyond the River. Whatever the priest Ezra, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, may ask of you, let it be done with diligence, <verse-number id="Ezr 7:22">22</verse-number>up to one hundred talents of silver, one hundred measures of wheat, one hundred baths of wine, one hundred baths of oil, and <idiom-start/>unlimited salt<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally, “salt that is not specified”</note> <verse-number id="Ezr 7:23">23</verse-number>All that is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done with diligence for the house of the God of heaven, otherwise wrath will come on the kingdom of the king and his sons. <verse-number id="Ezr 7:24">24</verse-number>You also should be aware that it is not permitted to place tax, tribute, or duty upon all of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the doorkeepers, the temple servants, and other servants of the house of God. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Ezr 7:25">25</verse-number>“You, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that you possess, appoint magistrates and judges who can judge all of the people <supplied>in the province</supplied> Beyond the River who know the laws of your God. And you will teach those who do not know. <verse-number id="Ezr 7:26">26</verse-number>All who do not obey the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed on him with diligence, whether for death or for banishment or for confiscation of goods and for imprisonment.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Ezr 7:27">27</verse-number>Blessed be Yahweh the God of our ancestors,<note>Or “fathers”</note> who put this in the heart of the king to glorify the house of Yahweh in Jerusalem <verse-number id="Ezr 7:28">28</verse-number>and who extended to me loyal love before the king and his counselors, and before all of the mighty officials of the king. I took courage, for the hand of Yahweh my God was upon me, and I gathered leaders from Israel to go up with me. </p>
