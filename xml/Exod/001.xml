			<pericope>Israel and Oppression in Egypt</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Ex 1:1">1</verse-number>And these <supplied>are</supplied> the names of the sons of Israel who came <supplied>to</supplied> Egypt; with Jacob, they each came with his <idiom-start/>family<idiom-end/>:<note>Literally “house”</note> <verse-number id="Ex 1:2">2</verse-number>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; <verse-number id="Ex 1:3">3</verse-number>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; <verse-number id="Ex 1:4">4</verse-number>Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. <verse-number id="Ex 1:5">5</verse-number>And <idiom-start/>all those who descended from Jacob<idiom-end/><note>Literally “every soul/individual/life, the ones going out from the loins of Jacob”</note> were seventy individuals,<note>Or “souls,” “lives”</note> and Joseph was in Egypt. <verse-number id="Ex 1:6">6</verse-number>And Joseph died and all of his brothers and all of that generation. <verse-number id="Ex 1:7">7</verse-number>And the <idiom-start/>Israelites<idiom-end/><note>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</note> were fruitful and multiplied and were many and were very, very numerous, and the land was filled with them. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Ex 1:8">8</verse-number>And a new king rose over Egypt who did not know Joseph. <verse-number id="Ex 1:9">9</verse-number>And he said to his people, “Look, the people of the <idiom-start/>Israelites<idiom-end/><note>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</note> <supplied>are</supplied> greater and more numerous than us. <verse-number id="Ex 1:10">10</verse-number>Come, we must deal shrewdly with them, lest they become many, and when war happens, they also will join our enemies and will fight against us and go up from the land.” <verse-number id="Ex 1:11">11</verse-number>And they appointed commanders of forced labor over them in order to oppress them with their <idiom-start/>forced labor<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “burdens” or “burdensome labor”</note> and they built storage cities for Pharaoh—Pithom and Rameses. <verse-number id="Ex 1:12">12</verse-number>And as he oppressed them, so they became many, and so they spread out, and <supplied>the Egyptians</supplied> were afraid because of the presence of the <idiom-start/>Israelites<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</note> <verse-number id="Ex 1:13">13</verse-number>And the Egyptians ruthlessly compelled the <idiom-start/>Israelites<idiom-end/><note>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</note> to work. <verse-number id="Ex 1:14">14</verse-number>And they made their lives bitter with hard work with mortar and with bricks and with all <supplied>sorts</supplied> of work in the field—with all their work in which they ruthlessly enslaved them. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Ex 1:15">15</verse-number>And the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives—of whom the name of the one <supplied>was</supplied> Shiphrah and the name of the second <supplied>was</supplied> Puah—<verse-number id="Ex 1:16">16</verse-number>and he said, “When you help the Hebrews give birth, you will look upon the pairs of testicles; if he <supplied>is</supplied> a son, you will put him to death, and if she <supplied>is</supplied> a daughter, she will live.” <verse-number id="Ex 1:17">17</verse-number>But the midwives feared God, and they did not do as the king of Egypt had said to them. They let the boys live. <verse-number id="Ex 1:18">18</verse-number>And the king of Egypt summoned the midwives, and he said to them, “Why have you done this thing and let the boys live?” <verse-number id="Ex 1:19">19</verse-number>And the midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew <supplied>women are</supplied> not like the Egyptian women, because they <supplied>are</supplied> vigorous; before the midwife comes to them, they have given birth.” <verse-number id="Ex 1:20">20</verse-number>And God did the midwives good, and the <supplied>Israelite</supplied> people became many and were very numerous. <verse-number id="Ex 1:21">21</verse-number><idiom-start/>And so<idiom-end/><note>Literally “and he/it was”</note> because the midwives feared God, he gave them <idiom-start/>families<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “houses”</note> <verse-number id="Ex 1:22">22</verse-number>And Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “Every son who is born you will throw into the Nile, and every daughter you will let live.” </p>
