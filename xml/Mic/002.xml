			<pericope>Woe to the Oppressors of God’s People</pericope>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 2:1">1</verse-number>Woe <supplied>to</supplied> those who plan wickedness </li1>
				<li2>and evil deeds upon their beds! </li2>
				<li1>In the light of the morning they did it, </li1>
				<li2>because they have power in their hands. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 2:2">2</verse-number>They covet fields and seize <supplied>them</supplied>, </li1>
				<li2>and houses, and they take <supplied>them</supplied> away. </li2>
				<li1>They oppress a man and his house; </li1>
				<li2>a man and his inheritance. </li2>
			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p><verse-number id="Mic 2:3">3</verse-number>Therefore, thus says Yahweh: Look! I am planning disaster against this family from which you will not be able to remove your necks. You will not walk proudly, for it <supplied>is</supplied> a time of disaster. </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 2:4">4</verse-number>In that day they will raise a proverb against you, </li1>
				<li2>and will wail a bitter wailing, saying, </li2>
				<li1>“We are utterly ruined; </li1>
				<li2>he exchanges <supplied>the</supplied> portion of my people. </li2>
				<li1>How he removes <supplied>it</supplied> from me; </li1>
				<li2>he apportions our field to an apostate.” </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 2:5">5</verse-number>Therefore you will have no one casting a line by lot </li1>
				<li2>in the assembly of Yahweh. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 2:6">6</verse-number>“Do not preach!” they are preaching. </li1>
				<li2>They should not preach to these; </li2>
				<li2>disgrace will not overtake us. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 2:7">7</verse-number>Should <supplied>this</supplied> be said, O house of Jacob? </li1>
				<li2>Is the patience<note>Or “spirit”</note> of Yahweh shortened? </li2>
				<li2><supplied>Are</supplied> these his deeds? </li2>
				<li1>Are my words not pleasing </li1>
				<li2>to him who walks upright? </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 2:8">8</verse-number>But <idiom-start/>recently<idiom-end/><note>Literally “yesterday”</note> my people have risen up as an enemy; </li1>
				<li2>from before the cloak you strip off the robe </li2>
				<li1>from those passing by <supplied>in</supplied> confidence, </li1>
				<li2>returning <supplied>from</supplied> war. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 2:9">9</verse-number>You have driven out the women of my people </li1>
				<li2>from the houses of their<note>Hebrew “her”</note> pleasure. </li2>
				<li1>From their<note>Hebrew “her”</note> children you have taken away </li1>
				<li2>my glory forever. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 2:10">10</verse-number>Arise and go, </li1>
				<li2>for this <supplied>is</supplied> no resting place, </li2>
				<li1>on account of uncleanness <supplied>that</supplied> destroys </li1>
				<li2>with painful destruction. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 2:11">11</verse-number>If a man walks about in a spirit of deception and lies, </li1>
				<li2><supplied>saying</supplied> “I will preach to you of wine and strong drink,” </li2>
				<li2>then he would be a preacher <supplied>for</supplied> this people! </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 2:12">12</verse-number>I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob; </li1>
				<li2>I will surely gather together the remainder of Israel. </li2>
				<li1>I will set them like sheep of Bozrah. </li1>
				<li1>Like a herd in the midst of their pasture </li1>
				<li2>they will be in tumult from people. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 2:13">13</verse-number>The one who breaks out before them goes up; </li1>
				<li2>they break through and pass the gate, </li2>
				<li2>going out through it. </li2>
				<li1>Their king passes before them, </li1>
				<li2>Yahweh at their head. </li2>
