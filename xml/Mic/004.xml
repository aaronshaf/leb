				<li1>the mountain of Yahweh </li1>
				<li2>will be established as the highest of the mountains, </li2>
				<li1>and it will be lifted up above the hills, </li1>
				<li2>and people will stream to it. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 4:2">2</verse-number>And many nations will come and say, </li1>
				<li1>“Come! Let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, </li1>
				<li2>and to the <idiom-start/>temple<idiom-end/><note>Literally “house”</note> of the God of Jacob, </li2>
				<li1>that he may teach us his ways, </li1>
				<li2>and that we may walk in his paths,” </li2>
				<li1>for the law will go out from Zion, </li1>
				<li2>and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 4:3">3</verse-number>And he will judge between many peoples </li1>
				<li2>and will arbitrate for strong nations far away; </li2>
				<li1>and they will beat their swords into plowshares </li1>
				<li2>and their spears into pruning hooks; </li2>
				<li1>nation will not lift up a sword against a nation, </li1>
				<li2>and they will no longer learn war. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 4:4">4</verse-number>But they will sit, each under his vine </li1>
				<li2>and under his fig tree, </li2>
				<li1>and no one will make them afraid, </li1>
				<li2>for the mouth of Yahweh of hosts has spoken. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 4:5">5</verse-number>For all the nations walk, </li1>
				<li2>each in the name of its god, </li2>
				<li1>but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God, </li1>
				<li2>forever and ever. </li2>

				<li2>“I will assemble the one who limps, </li2>
				<li1>and I will gather the one who has been scattered, </li1>
				<li2>and <supplied>those</supplied> whom I have mistreated. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 4:7">7</verse-number>And I will make the one who limps a remnant, </li1>

				<li2>Is there no king in you? </li2>
				<li1>Has your counselor perished </li1>
				<li2>that pangs like a woman in labor have seized you? </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 4:10">10</verse-number>Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion, </li1>
				<li2>like a woman in labor. </li2>
				<li1>For now you will go forth from the city, </li1>
				<li2>and you will camp in the field; </li2>
				<li2>you will go to Babylon. </li2>
				<li1>There you will be rescued; </li1>
				<li2>there Yahweh will redeem you </li2>
				<li2>from the hand of your enemies. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 4:11">11</verse-number>And now, many nations are gathered against you </li1>
				<li2>who are saying, ‘Let her be defiled, </li2>
				<li2>and let our eyes gaze upon Zion.’ </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 4:12">12</verse-number>But they do not know the thoughts of Yahweh, </li1>
				<li2>and they do not understand his plan, </li2>
				<li1>that he has gathered them as sheaves </li1>
				<li2>to his threshing floor. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Mic 4:13">13</verse-number>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, </li1>
				<li2>for your horn I will make <supplied>as</supplied> iron </li2>
				<li2>and your hooves <supplied>as</supplied> bronze. </li2>
				<li1>And you will break many peoples in pieces, </li1>
				<li2>and their gain you will devote to destruction to Yahweh, </li2>
				<li2>and their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.” </li2>
