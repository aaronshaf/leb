				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:1">1</verse-number>Say to your brother,<note>Hebrew “brothers”</note> “Ammi,”<note>Ammi means “My people”</note> </li1>
				<li1>and to your sister,<note>Hebrew “sisters”</note> “Ruhamah.”<note>Ruhamah means “Pitied”</note> </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:2">2</verse-number>Plead with your mother, plead— </li1>
				<li2>because she <supplied>is</supplied> not my wife, </li2>
				<li3>and I <supplied>am</supplied> not her husband. </li3>
				<li1>Let her put away her whoring <idiom-start/>from before her<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “from her face”</note> </li1>
				<li2>and her adultery from between her breasts. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:3">3</verse-number>Lest I strip her naked </li1>
				<li2>and expose her like the day when she was born; </li2>
				<li1>I will make her like the desert </li1>
				<li2>and turn her into parched land; </li2>
				<li3>I will kill her with thirst. </li3>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:4">4</verse-number>And I will not have pity on her children, </li1>
				<li2>because <supplied>they are</supplied> children of whoredom. </li2>
				<li3><verse-number id="Ho 2:5">5</verse-number>Because their mother was unfaithful;<note>Or “their mother played the whore”</note> </li3>
				<li1>she who conceived them has acted shamefully, </li1>
				<li2>for she said: </li2>
				<li3>“I will go after my lovers, </li3>
				<li1>the ones who give <supplied>me</supplied> my bread, my water, </li1>
				<li2>my wool, and my flax, </li2>
				<li3>my oil, and my drink.” </li3>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:6">6</verse-number>Therefore, Look! </li1>
				<li2>I <supplied>am</supplied> going to hedge her path<note>Hebrew “your path”</note> <idiom-start/>with thorns<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “with the thorns”</note> </li2>
				<li3>and I will build a stone wall, a stone wall <supplied>against</supplied> her, </li3>
				<li2>and she will not find her paths. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:7">7</verse-number>Then she will pursue <idiom-start/>her lovers<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “the ones who love her”</note> </li1>
				<li2>but she will not overtake them; </li2>
				<li3>she will seek them and not find <supplied>them</supplied>; </li3>
				<li1>and she will say, “I will go </li1>
				<li2>and return to my first husband </li2>
				<li2>because <supplied>it was</supplied> better for me then than now.” </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:8">8</verse-number>But she did not know </li1>
				<li2>that <supplied>it was</supplied> I who gave her </li2>
				<li3>grain, new wine, and oil, </li3>
				<li1>and who gave her silver in abundance, </li1>
				<li2>and gold which they made into a Baal. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:9">9</verse-number>Therefore I will take again </li1>
				<li2>my grain in its time, </li2>
				<li3>and my wine in its season; </li3>
				<li1>and I will take away my wool and my flax, </li1>
				<li2><supplied>which were</supplied> to cover her nakedness. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:10">10</verse-number>And now I will uncover her nakedness </li1>
				<li2>before the eyes of her lovers, </li2>
				<li3>and no one will rescue her from my hand. </li3>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:11">11</verse-number>And I will put an end to all her mirth, </li1>
				<li2>her festivals,<note>Hebrew “festival”</note> her new moons,<note>Hebrew “new moon”</note> and her Sabbaths,<note>Hebrew “Sabbath”</note> </li2>
				<li3>and all her appointed festivals;<note>Hebrew “festival”</note> </li3>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:12">12</verse-number>and I will lay waste to her vines<note>Hebrew “vine”</note> and her fig trees,<note>Hebrew “fig tree”</note> </li1>
				<li2>of which she said, </li2>
				<li3>“They <supplied>are</supplied> my payment for prostitution, </li3>
				<li2>which my lovers gave to me.” </li2>
				<li1>I will make them a forest, </li1>
				<li2>and the wild animals<note>Hebrew “animal”</note> of the field will devour them. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:13">13</verse-number><idiom-start/>I will punish her<idiom-end/><note>Literally “To visit sins upon her;” see 1:4</note> <supplied>for</supplied> the days of the Baals, </li1>
				<li2>to whom she burns incense, </li2>
				<li1>and she decked herself <supplied>with</supplied> her ornamental ring and jewelry, </li1>
				<li2>and she went after her lovers, and forgot me </li2>
				<li3>—a declaration of Yahweh. </li3>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:14">14</verse-number>Therefore, Look! I <supplied>am</supplied> going to allure her </li1>
				<li2>and bring her <supplied>into</supplied> the desert, </li2>
				<li3>and <idiom-start/>I will speak tenderly to her<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “I will speak to her heart”</note> </li3>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:15">15</verse-number>From there I will give her </li1>
				<li2>her vineyards, </li2>
				<li3>and the Valley of Achor as a doorway of hope. </li3>
				<li1>And there she will respond, </li1>
				<li2>as <supplied>in</supplied> the days of her youth, </li2>
				<li2>just as <supplied>in</supplied> the day of her coming out of </li2>
				<li3>the land of Egypt. </li3>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:16">16</verse-number><idiom-start/>And on that day<idiom-end/>—<note>Literally, “And it will happen on that day”</note> </li1>
				<li2>a declaration of Yahweh— </li2>
				<li3>you will call me, “My husband;”<note>Hebrew “Ishi”</note> </li3>
				<li3>you will no longer call me, “My Baal.”<note>Hebrew “Baali”</note> </li3>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:17">17</verse-number>I will remove the names </li1>
				<li2>of the Baals from her mouth, </li2>
				<li3>and they will no longer be mentioned by their name. </li3>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:18">18</verse-number>I will make a covenant for them on that day, </li1>
				<li2>with the animals<note>Hebrew “animal”</note> of the field, </li2>
				<li2>with the birds<note>Hebrew “bird”</note> of the heaven, and </li2>
				<li2><supplied>with</supplied> the creeping things<note>Hebrew “creeping thing”</note> of the ground; </li2>
				<li3><supplied>the</supplied> bow, <supplied>the</supplied> sword, and <supplied>the</supplied> war I will abolish from the land, and I will let them lie down in safety. </li3>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:19">19</verse-number>And I will take you as my wife forever; </li1>
				<li2>I will take you as a wife for myself in righteousness and in justice, </li2>
				<li3>in steadfast love and in mercy. </li3>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:20">20</verse-number><idiom-start/>I will take you as my wife<idiom-end/><note>Literally “I will take you as a wife to me”</note> in faithfulness, </li1>
				<li2>and you will know Yahweh. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:21">21</verse-number>On that day I will answer, <idiom-start/>declares Yahweh<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “a declaration of Yahweh</note> </li1>
				<li2>I will answer the heavens, </li2>
				<li3>and they will answer the earth. </li3>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ho 2:22">22</verse-number>And the earth will answer </li1>
				<li2>the grain, the wine, and the oil, </li2>
				<li1>and they will answer Jezreel.<note>Jezreel means “God sows”</note> </li1>
				<li2><verse-number id="Ho 2:23">23</verse-number>I will sow her for myself in the land; </li2>
				<li3>I will have pity on Lo-ruhama;<note>Lo-ruhama means “Not pitied”</note> </li3>
				<li2>I will say to Lo-ammi,<note>Lo-ammi means “Not my people”</note> </li2>
