				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:1">1</verse-number>I will stand at my post, </li1>
				<li2>and station myself on <supplied>the</supplied> rampart. </li2>
				<li1>And I will keep watch to see what he will say to me, </li1>
				<li2>and what he will answer concerning my complaint. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:2">2</verse-number>Then Yahweh answered me and said, </li1>
				<li1>“Write <supplied>the</supplied> vision and make <supplied>it</supplied> plain on the tablet </li1>
				<li2>so that <idiom-start/>it might be read quickly<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “it might run reading upon it”</note> </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:3">3</verse-number>For <supplied>there is</supplied> yet a vision for the appointed time; </li1>
				<li2>it will give witness to the end, and it will not lie. </li2>
				<li1>If it tarries, wait for it, </li1>
				<li2>for it will surely come and not delay. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:4">4</verse-number>Look! His spirit within him is puffed up; </li1>
				<li2>it is not upright. </li2>
				<li2>But the righteous shall live by his faithfulness. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:5">5</verse-number><idiom-start/>How much less<idiom-end/><note>Literally “And moreover because”</note> the defiant;<note>“Defiant” follows the Dead Sea Scrolls (1QpHab)</note> </li1>
				<li2><supplied>the</supplied> arrogant, treacherous man? </li2>
				<li1>He who broadens his throat like Sheol, </li1>
				<li2>and who, like death, is not satisfied, </li2>
				<li1>and who gathers to himself all the nations, </li1>
				<li2>and harvested for himself all the peoples, </li2>
				<li2>will not succeed. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:6">6</verse-number>Shall not all of these take up a taunt against him, </li1>
				<li2>with ridicule and riddles against him, saying, </li2>
				<li1>‘Woe to him who heaps up what is not his’? </li1>
				<li2><supplied>For</supplied> how long? </li2>
				<li2>And, ‘<supplied>Woe to him</supplied> who makes himself heavy with pledges’? </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:7">7</verse-number>Will not your creditors suddenly rise up </li1>
				<li2>and awaken those who make you tremble? </li2>
				<li2>Then you shall be as plunder for them. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:8">8</verse-number>Because you plundered many nations, </li1>
				<li2>all the remaining nations will plunder you </li2>
				<li1>on account of the blood of humanity </li1>
				<li2>and violence <supplied>against the</supplied> land, </li2>
				<li2><supplied>and against</supplied> cities and all who live in them. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:9">9</verse-number>Woe to <supplied>him who</supplied> obtains profit <supplied>from</supplied> evil gain for his house, </li1>
				<li2>to set his nest on high, </li2>
				<li2>to be saved from the hand of misfortune! </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:10">10</verse-number>You have plotted shame for your house, </li1>
				<li2>cutting off many peoples </li2>
				<li2>and sinning against your life. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:11">11</verse-number>For the stone will cry out from the wall, </li1>
				<li2>and <supplied>the</supplied> plaster from <supplied>the</supplied> wood will answer it. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:12">12</verse-number>Woe to <supplied>him who</supplied> builds a city by bloodguilt, </li1>
				<li2>and <supplied>who</supplied> founds a city by wickedness! </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:13">13</verse-number>Look! <supplied>Is it</supplied> not from Yahweh of hosts </li1>
				<li2>that people labor for mere fire, </li2>
				<li2>and nations exhaust themselves for mere vanity? </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:14">14</verse-number>For the earth will be filled </li1>
				<li2>with the knowledge of the glory of Yahweh, </li2>
				<li2>like the waters covering the sea. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:15">15</verse-number>Woe to <supplied>him who</supplied> gives a drink to his neighbors, </li1>
				<li2>pouring out your wrath and also making <supplied>them</supplied> drunk </li2>
				<li2>in order to see their nakedness! </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:16">16</verse-number>You will be sated with shame rather than glory. </li1>
				<li2>Drink also yourself, and expose yourself! </li2>
				<li1>The cup of the right hand of Yahweh </li1>
				<li2>will come around upon you </li2>
				<li2>and disgrace upon your glory. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:17">17</verse-number>For <supplied>the</supplied> violence of Lebanon will cover you, </li1>
				<li2>and <supplied>the</supplied> destruction of wild animals will shatter them </li2>
				<li1>on account of the blood of humanity, </li1>
				<li2>and <supplied>the</supplied> violence <supplied>against the</supplied> land, </li2>
				<li2><supplied>against</supplied> a city and all the inhabitants in it. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:18">18</verse-number>What value <supplied>is</supplied> an idol </li1>
				<li2>when its carver has fashioned it, </li2>
				<li2>a molten idol, a teacher of lies? </li2>
				<li1>For <supplied>he who</supplied> fashioned his creation trusts in it, </li1>
				<li2><supplied>though</supplied> making mute idols! </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:19">19</verse-number>Woe to <supplied>him who</supplied> says to the wood, ‘Wake up!’ </li1>
				<li2><supplied>And</supplied> to a lifeless stone, ‘Arise!’ </li2>
				<li2>Can he teach? </li2>
				<li1>Look, it is covered <supplied>with</supplied> gold and silver, </li1>
				<li2>and there is no breath within it. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Hab 2:20">20</verse-number>But Yahweh <supplied>is</supplied> in his holy temple. </li1>
				<li2>Let all the earth be silent before him.” </li2>
