			<pericope>Concerning the Collection for the Saints</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Co 16:1">1</verse-number> Now concerning the collection for the saints: just as I gave directions about <supplied>it</supplied> to the churches of Galatia, so you do also. <verse-number id="1 Co 16:2">2</verse-number>On the first <supplied>day</supplied> of the week, each one of you <idiom-start/>put aside<idiom-end/><note>Literally “put from himself”</note> <supplied>something</supplied>, saving up <idiom-start/>to whatever extent he has prospered<idiom-end/><note>Literally “whatever if anything he has been prospered”</note>, in order that whenever I come, at that time collections do not take place. <verse-number id="1 Co 16:3">3</verse-number>And whenever I arrive, whomever you approve by letters, I will send these to take your gift to Jerusalem. <verse-number id="1 Co 16:4">4</verse-number>And if it is worthwhile for me to go also, they will travel with me. </p>
			<p/>
			<pericope>Travel Plans for Paul and Associates</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Co 16:5">5</verse-number>But I will come to you whenever I go through Macedonia (for I am going through Macedonia), <verse-number id="1 Co 16:6">6</verse-number>and perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way wherever I may go. <verse-number id="1 Co 16:7">7</verse-number>For I do not want to see you now in passing, for I hope to remain some time with you, if the Lord allows <supplied>it</supplied>. <verse-number id="1 Co 16:8">8</verse-number>But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost, <verse-number id="1 Co 16:9">9</verse-number>for a great and effective door has opened for me, and <supplied>there are</supplied> many opponents. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Co 16:10">10</verse-number>But if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without cause to fear, for he is carrying out the Lord’s work, as I also <supplied>am</supplied>. <verse-number id="1 Co 16:11">11</verse-number>Therefore do not let anyone disdain him, but send him <supplied>on his way</supplied> in peace in order that he may come to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Co 16:12">12</verse-number>Now concerning Apollos our brother, I urged him many <supplied>times</supplied> that he should come to you with the brothers, and he was not at all willing that he should come now, but he will come whenever he has <supplied>an</supplied> opportunity. </p>
			<p/>
			<pericope>Concluding Exhortations</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Co 16:13">13</verse-number>Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act courageously, be strong. <verse-number id="1 Co 16:14">14</verse-number>All your <supplied>actions</supplied> must be done in love. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Co 16:15">15</verse-number>Now I urge you, brothers—you know about the household of Stephanas, that they are the first fruits of Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the ministry for the saints—<verse-number id="1 Co 16:16">16</verse-number>that you also be subject to such people, and to all those who work together and labor. <verse-number id="1 Co 16:17">17</verse-number>Now I rejoice over the arrival of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because these make up for your absence, <verse-number id="1 Co 16:18">18</verse-number>for they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore recognize such people. </p>
			<p/>
			<pericope>Final Greetings and Benediction</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Co 16:19">19</verse-number>The churches of <supplied>the province of</supplied> Asia<note>That is, the Roman province of Asia, known today as Asia Minor</note> greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you in the Lord many <supplied>times</supplied>, together with the church in their house. <verse-number id="1 Co 16:20">20</verse-number>All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Co 16:21">21</verse-number>The greeting <supplied>is</supplied> by my hand—Paul’s. <verse-number id="1 Co 16:22">22</verse-number>If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed. O Lord, come!<note>The Aramaic expression <i>marana tha</i> (“O Lord, come!”) can also be rendered <i>maran atha</i> (“our Lord has come”); it is used here by Paul without explanation</note> </p>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Co 16:23">23</verse-number>The grace of the Lord Jesus <supplied>be</supplied> with you. <verse-number id="1 Co 16:24">24</verse-number>My love <supplied>be</supplied> with all of you in Christ Jesus. </p>
