			<pericope>Maiden’s Soliloquy</pericope>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1><verse-number id="So 1:2">2</verse-number><idiom-start/>May<note>In the maiden’s soliloquy, she thinks about her beloved in her thoughts (“May he kiss me!”), then poetically speaks to him as if he were in her presence (“for your love is better than wine”). To avoid confusion, the translation uses the second-person form throughout vv. <cite title="BibleLEB2:So 1:2–4">2–4</cite></note> you kiss me<idiom-end/><note>Literally “May he kiss me”</note> <idiom-start/>passionately with your lips<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “with the kisses of his mouth”</note> </li1>
				<li2>for your love <supplied>is</supplied> better than wine.<note>The shift from the third person “he … his” to the second person “you … your” in vv. <cite title="BibleLEB2:So 1:2–4">2–4</cite> should not be interpreted as suggesting two different referents, that is, one male whom the maiden is addressing as “you,” and another to whom she refers as “he.” Rather, this shift is a poetic device (called “grammatical differentiation”) that is not uncommon in Hebrew poetry (e.g., <cite title="BibleLEB2: Ge 49:4">Gen 49:4</cite>; <cite title="BibleLEB2: Dt 32:15">Deut 32:15</cite>; <cite title="BibleLEB2: Ps 23:2–5">Psa 23:2–5</cite>; <cite title="BibleLEB2: Is 1:29">Isa 1:29</cite>; <cite title="BibleLEB2: Is 42:20">42:20</cite>; <cite title="BibleLEB2: Is 54:1">54:1</cite>; <cite title="BibleLEB2: Je 22:24">Jer 22:24</cite>; <cite title="BibleLEB2: Am 4:1">Amos 4:1</cite>; <cite title="BibleLEB2: Mic 7:19">Mic 7:19</cite>; <cite title="BibleLEB2: La 3:1">Lam 3:1</cite>; <cite title="BibleLEB2: So 4:2">Song 4:2</cite>; <cite title="BibleLEB2: So 6:6">6:6</cite>). This shift is characteristic of a soliloquy, a dramatic or literary form in which a character reveals her thoughts without addressing a listener who is actually present (e.g., <cite title="BibleLEB2: 2 Sa 19:4">2 Sam 19:4</cite>). In this case, the maiden’s private thoughts about her beloved (v. <cite title="BibleLEB2:So 1:2a">2a</cite>) shift to an imaginary address to her beloved (vv. <cite title="BibleLEB2:So 1:2b–4a">2b–4a</cite>)</note> </li2>

				<li1>Let us be joyful and let us rejoice in you; </li1>
				<li2>let us extol your love more than wine. </li2>
				<li3>Rightly do they love you! </li3>

				<li2>like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="So 1:6">6</verse-number>Do not gaze at me because I am black, <note>This is figurative for the maiden’s physical appearance; her skin was darkly tanned</note> </li1>
				<li2>because the sun has stared <supplied>at</supplied> me. </li2>
				<li1>The sons of my mother were angry with me; </li1>

				<li3>where do your sheep lie down at the noon? </li3>
				<li1><idiom-start/>For why should I be like<idiom-end/><note>Literally “For to what will I be like”</note> one who is veiled<note>The reading of the MT (“like one who is veiled”) is supported by the LXX. However, several ancient versions (Syriac Peshitta, Latin Vulgate, Symmachus) reflect an alternate Hebrew textual tradition in which two letters are transposed, resulting in the reading “like one who wanders about.” This makes good sense contextually, since the maiden does not know where her beloved would be at noon</note> </li1>
				<li2>beside the flocks of your companions? </li2>
