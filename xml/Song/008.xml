				<li2>the <idiom-start/>sweet wine<idiom-end/><note>Or “juice”</note> of my pomegranates.<note>The traditional Hebrew reads the singular “my pomegranate.” However, the plural reading “my pomegranates” is attested in numerous medieval Hebrew manuscripts and is reflected in the ancient versions (Greek Septuagint, Aramaic Targum, Syriac Peshitta). The latter makes the most sense in this context as a euphemistic description of the maiden’s delights</note> </li2>
