			<pericope>Aaron and Miriam Murmur Against Moses</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Nu 12:1">1</verse-number>And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he took (because he took a Cushite wife); <verse-number id="Nu 12:2">2</verse-number>and they said, “Has Yahweh spoken only through Moses? Has not Yahweh also spoken through us?” And Yahweh heard it. <verse-number id="Nu 12:3">3</verse-number>Now the man, Moses, <supplied>was</supplied> more humble than any other person on the face of the earth, <verse-number id="Nu 12:4">4</verse-number>and Yahweh said suddenly to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “Go out, you three, to the tent of assembly.” So the three of them when out. <verse-number id="Nu 12:5">5</verse-number>And Yahweh went down in a column of cloud and stood <supplied>at</supplied> the doorway of the tent, and he called Aaron and Miriam, and the two of them went, <verse-number id="Nu 12:6">6</verse-number>and he said, </p>

			<ul>
				<li1>“Please hear my words: </li1>
				<li2>If there is a prophet among you, I, Yahweh, </li2>
				<li1>will make myself known to him in a vision. </li1>
				<li2>I will speak to him in a dream.<note>Hebrew “the dream”</note> </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Nu 12:7">7</verse-number>Not so with my servant Moses; </li1>
				<li2>in all my house he <supplied>is</supplied> faithful. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Nu 12:8">8</verse-number>I will speak to him mouth to mouth, </li1>
				<li2><supplied>in</supplied> clearness, not in riddles; </li2>
				<li1>and he will look at the form of Yahweh. </li1>
			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p>Why were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Nu 12:9">9</verse-number><idiom-start/>And Yahweh became very angry<idiom-end/><note>Literally “And the nose of Yahweh became hot”</note> with them, and he went <supplied>away</supplied>. <verse-number id="Nu 12:10">10</verse-number>And the cloud departed from on the tent, and behold, Miriam <supplied>was</supplied> infected with <idiom-start/>a skin disease<idiom-end/><note>The precise meaning is uncertain; many modern translations suggest “leprosy”</note> white like snow; when Aaron turned toward Miriam, behold, <supplied>she was</supplied> afflicted with a skin disease. <verse-number id="Nu 12:11">11</verse-number>So Aaron said to Moses, “Please, my lord, please do not put on us <supplied>this</supplied> sin <supplied>in</supplied> which we were foolish and <supplied>in</supplied> which we have sinned. <verse-number id="Nu 12:12">12</verse-number>Please do not let her be like the dead, whose flesh is half consumed when coming out from the womb of its mother.” <verse-number id="Nu 12:13">13</verse-number>And Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, “God, <idiom-start/>please heal her<idiom-end/>!”<note>Literally “Please heal please her”</note> <verse-number id="Nu 12:14">14</verse-number>But Yahweh said to Moses, “<supplied>If</supplied> her father had surely spit in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days? Let her be confined for seven days to an outside place of the camp, and afterward she may be gathered.” <verse-number id="Nu 12:15">15</verse-number>So Miriam was confined to the outside place of the camp seven days, and the people did not set out until Miriam was gathered. <verse-number id="Nu 12:16">16</verse-number>And afterward the people set out from Hazeroth, and they encamped in the desert of Paran. </p>
