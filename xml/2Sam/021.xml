			<pericope>The Famine Brings Justice</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Sa 21:1">1</verse-number>There <supplied>was</supplied> a famine in the days of David <supplied>for</supplied> three years, year after year. And David <idiom-start/>inquired of Yahweh<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “sought the face of Yahweh”</note> and Yahweh said, “The bloodguilt <supplied>is</supplied> on Saul and on his household, because he killed the Gibeonites.” <verse-number id="2 Sa 21:2">2</verse-number>So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. Now the Gibeonites <supplied>were</supplied> not from the <idiom-start/>Israelites<idiom-end/>;<note>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</note> they <supplied>were</supplied> from the remainder of the Amorites. Now the <idiom-start/>Israelites<idiom-end/><note>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</note> had sworn to them,<note>The treaty between Israel and the Gibeonites is found in Josh 9</note> but Saul tried to wipe them out in his zeal for the <idiom-start/>Israelites<idiom-end/><note>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</note> and Judah. <verse-number id="2 Sa 21:3">3</verse-number>So David asked the Gibeonites, “What can I do for you, and with what can I make amends that you may bless the inheritance of Yahweh?” <verse-number id="2 Sa 21:4">4</verse-number>Then the Gibeonites said to him, “<idiom-start/>It is not a matter for us of<idiom-end/><note>Literally “There is not for me (<i>Qere</i> ‘us’)”</note> silver or gold with Saul or with his household. It is not for us to put to death anyone in Israel.” He asked, “What <supplied>are</supplied> you saying <supplied>that</supplied> I should do for you all?” <verse-number id="2 Sa 21:5">5</verse-number>Then they said to the king, “The man who consumed us and who plotted against us <supplied>so that</supplied> we were destroyed from existing in all of the territory of Israel, <verse-number id="2 Sa 21:6">6</verse-number>let seven men from his sons be given over to us, and we will execute them before Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen one of Yahweh.” Then the king said, “I will give them over.” <verse-number id="2 Sa 21:7">7</verse-number>But the king spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the sworn oath of Yahweh which <supplied>was</supplied> between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul. <verse-number id="2 Sa 21:8">8</verse-number>So the king took two of the sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, namely Armoni and Mephibosheth, and five of the sons of Michal the daughter of Saul whom she had borne to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite. <verse-number id="2 Sa 21:9">9</verse-number>He gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they executed them on the mountain in the presence of Yahweh, and the seven fell together. Now they were put to death in the days of the harvest, at the beginning of the harvest of barley. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Sa 21:10">10</verse-number>Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took the sackcloth, and she spread it for herself on the rock at the beginning of the harvest until water gushed forth on them from heaven, but she did not allow the birds of heaven to rest on them by day nor the animals of the field by night. <verse-number id="2 Sa 21:11">11</verse-number>David <supplied>was</supplied> told about what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done. <verse-number id="2 Sa 21:12">12</verse-number>So David left and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the rulers of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from the public square of Beth Shan, where <supplied>the</supplied> Philistines hung them <idiom-start/>when<idiom-end/><note>Literally “on the day”</note> <supplied>the</supplied> Philistines killed Saul on Gilboa. <verse-number id="2 Sa 21:13">13</verse-number>He brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there, and they gathered the bones of the executed. <verse-number id="2 Sa 21:14">14</verse-number>And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the land of Benjamin at Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father. They did all that the king had commanded, and afterward God was entreated for the land. </p>

			<pericope>Battles with the Philistines Recounted</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Sa 21:15">15</verse-number>There <supplied>was</supplied> war again for <supplied>the</supplied> Philistines with Israel, and David and his servants with him went down, and they fought <supplied>the</supplied> Philistines, and David grew weary. <verse-number id="2 Sa 21:16">16</verse-number>Now Yishbi in Nob, who <supplied>was</supplied> among the descendents of Raphah<note>The descendants of Raphah (i.e., the Rephaim) <supplied>were</supplied> thought to be giants</note> (now the weight of his spearhead <supplied>was</supplied> three hundredweight of bronze, and he <supplied>was</supplied> newly armed), said that he would kill David. <verse-number id="2 Sa 21:17">17</verse-number>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and he attacked the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, “You shall not go out with us any longer to the battle, so that you do not quench the lamp of Israel.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Sa 21:18">18</verse-number>It happened afterward that there <supplied>was</supplied> again battle at Gob with <supplied>the</supplied> Philistines. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph who <supplied>was</supplied> among the descendants of the Raphah. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Sa 21:19">19</verse-number>There <supplied>was</supplied> again a battle with <supplied>the</supplied> Philistines at Gob. And Elhanan the son of Jaare-Oregim, the Bethlehemite, killed Goliath<note>In view of the account of David and Goliath in 1 Sam 17, it <supplied>is</supplied> likely that Elhanan actually killed the brother of Goliath, Lahmi, in 1 Chr 20:5</note> the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear <supplied>was</supplied> like the beam of a weaver. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Sa 21:20">20</verse-number>Once again there <supplied>was</supplied> battle at Gath, and there <supplied>was</supplied> <idiom-start/>a man of great size<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “a man of measurement”</note> The fingers of his hand and the toes of his feet <supplied>were</supplied> six and six, twenty-four in number. He <supplied>was</supplied> also born to the Raphah. <verse-number id="2 Sa 21:21">21</verse-number>He taunted Israel but Jonathan the son of Shimei, the brother of David, killed him. <verse-number id="2 Sa 21:22">22</verse-number>These four <supplied>were</supplied> born for the Raphah in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants. </p>
