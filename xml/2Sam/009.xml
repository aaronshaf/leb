			<p><verse-number id="2 Sa 9:1">1</verse-number>Then David said, “<supplied>Is</supplied> there still anyone who <supplied>is</supplied> left for the house of Saul that I may show loyal love to him for the sake of Jonathan?” <verse-number id="2 Sa 9:2">2</verse-number>Now Saul’s household had a servant whose name <supplied>was</supplied> Ziba, so they summoned him to David, and the king asked him, “<supplied>Are</supplied> you Ziba?” He said, “<idiom-start/>At your service<idiom-end/>!”<note>Literally “Your servant”</note> <verse-number id="2 Sa 9:3">3</verse-number>Then the king said, “But <supplied>is</supplied> there still anyone of Saul’s household that I may show the loyal love of God with him?” And Ziba said to the king, “There <supplied>is</supplied> still a son of Jonathan <supplied>who is</supplied> lame in the feet.” <verse-number id="2 Sa 9:4">4</verse-number>The king said to him, “Where <supplied>is</supplied> he?” And Ziba said to the king, “<idiom-start/>He <supplied>is</supplied> here<idiom-end/><note>Literally “Look, he”</note> in the house of Makir the son of Ammiel in Lo Debar.” <verse-number id="2 Sa 9:5">5</verse-number>So King David sent and brought him from the house of Makir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar. <verse-number id="2 Sa 9:6">6</verse-number>So Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David. And he fell on his face and did obeisance. David said, “Mephibosheth,” and he said, “<idiom-start/>I am ready to serve you<idiom-end/>.”<note>Literally “Here <supplied>is</supplied> your servant”</note> <verse-number id="2 Sa 9:7">7</verse-number>Then David said to him, “Don’t be afraid, for <idiom-start/>I will certainly show<idiom-end/><note>Literally “doing I will do” or “showing I will show”</note> loyal love to you for the sake of Jonathan your father, and I will restore to you all the lands of Saul your father. And you shall always eat food at my table.” <verse-number id="2 Sa 9:8">8</verse-number>Then he<note>Mephibosheth</note> did obeisance and said, “What <supplied>is</supplied> your servant that you have paid attention to the dead dog like me?” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Sa 9:9">9</verse-number>David summoned Ziba the servant of Saul and said to him, “All that <supplied>was</supplied> Saul’s and all his household I have given to the son of your master. <verse-number id="2 Sa 9:10">10</verse-number>You shall till the land for him, you and your sons and your servants; you shall bring <supplied>in the produce</supplied> and it shall be food for the son of your master that he may eat. But Mephibosheth the son of your master may always eat food at my table.” (Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty slaves.) <verse-number id="2 Sa 9:11">11</verse-number>Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my master the king commands his servant, so your servant will do.” So Mephibosheth <supplied>was</supplied> eating at his table as one of the sons of the king. <verse-number id="2 Sa 9:12">12</verse-number>Now Mephibosheth had a young son whose name <supplied>was</supplied> Micah, and all of the dwelling of the household of Ziba <supplied>became</supplied> servants for Mephibosheth. <verse-number id="2 Sa 9:13">13</verse-number>And Mephibosheth <supplied>was</supplied> living in Jerusalem, because he <supplied>was</supplied> continually eating at the table of the king, <supplied>even though</supplied> he <supplied>was</supplied> lame in both of his feet. </p>
