			<pericope>Israel Separates Itself</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Ne 13:1">1</verse-number>On that day the book of Moses was read in the hearing of the people and it was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever come into the assembly of God <verse-number id="Ne 13:2">2</verse-number>because they did not come to meet the <idiom-start/>Israelites<idiom-end/><note>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</note> with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them in order to curse them—but our God changed the curse into a blessing. <verse-number id="Ne 13:3">3</verse-number>So it happened when they heard the law<note>Hebrew <i>torah</i></note> that they separated all of the foreign people from Israel. </p>

			<pericope>Nehemiah Brings Reform</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Ne 13:4">4</verse-number>Before this, Eliashib the priest who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God—the one related to Tobiah— <verse-number id="Ne 13:5">5</verse-number>prepared for <supplied>Tobiah</supplied> a large chamber where they had formerly put the grain offering, the frankincense, the <supplied>temple</supplied> objects, tithes of grain, wine, and oil commanded for the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the offerings of the priests. <verse-number id="Ne 13:6">6</verse-number>During all of this, I was not in Jerusalem because in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king. At the end of <supplied>some</supplied> days I asked permission from the king <supplied>to leave</supplied>. <verse-number id="Ne 13:7">7</verse-number>So I came to Jerusalem. And I came to learn of the wrong that Eliashib had done for Tobiah by making him a room in the courtyard of the house of God. <verse-number id="Ne 13:8">8</verse-number>It was very displeasing for me, and I threw all of the objects from the house of Tobiah outside of the chamber. <verse-number id="Ne 13:9">9</verse-number>And I spoke <supplied>in order</supplied>, and they cleansed the chambers. Then I returned the objects of the house of God—the grain offering and the frankincense. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Ne 13:10">10</verse-number>And then I came to learn that the food of the Levites had not been given to them, so that the Levites and the singers, the doers of the work, had gone back each to his field. <verse-number id="Ne 13:11">11</verse-number>So I quarreled with the prefects, and I said, “Why is the house of God forsaken?” And I gathered them and set them at their station. <verse-number id="Ne 13:12">12</verse-number>So all of Judah brought the tithe of grain, new wine, and olive oil into the storehouses. <verse-number id="Ne 13:13">13</verse-number>I appointed as treasurer over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, Pedaiah from the Levites, and as their hand Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, for they were considered faithful. <supplied>The responsibility given</supplied> to them was to distribute to their brothers. <verse-number id="Ne 13:14">14</verse-number>Remember me, my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my loyal acts which I have done in the house of my God and in his service. </p>

			<pericope>Nehemiah Begins Sabbath Reforms</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Ne 13:15">15</verse-number>In those days I saw in Judah <supplied>people</supplied> treading the wine press on the Sabbath, bringing in heaps <supplied>of grain</supplied> and loading them on donkeys along with wine, grapes and figs, and every kind of burden and bringing <supplied>it all</supplied> to Jerusalem on the day of the Sabbath. And I warned them at that time against selling food. <verse-number id="Ne 13:16">16</verse-number>Tyrian men who lived in <supplied>Jerusalem</supplied> brought fish and every kind of merchandise and sold <supplied>it</supplied> on the Sabbath to the descendants<note>Or “sons”</note> of Judah and in Jerusalem. <verse-number id="Ne 13:17">17</verse-number>So I quarreled with the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the day of the Sabbath? <verse-number id="Ne 13:18">18</verse-number>Did not your ancestors<note>Or “fathers”</note> do this also, and our God brought on us all of this disaster and on this city <supplied>too</supplied>? Now you are adding fierce wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath!” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Ne 13:19">19</verse-number>So when it became dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors be shut and said that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. And I appointed some of my young men over the gates <supplied>to prevent</supplied> any <idiom-start/>goods<idiom-end/><note>Literally “burden”</note> being brought in on the day of the Sabbath. <verse-number id="Ne 13:20">20</verse-number>So the merchants and the sellers of merchandise spent the night outside of Jerusalem once or twice. <verse-number id="Ne 13:21">21</verse-number>But I warned them and said to them, “Why are you spending the night opposite the wall? If you do <supplied>it again</supplied>, I will lay hands against you.” From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath. <verse-number id="Ne 13:22">22</verse-number>And then I told two Levites that they must purify themselves and come to guard the gates in order to consecrate the day of the Sabbath. Remember this also, my God, and take pity on me according to the greatness of your loyal love. </p>

			<pericope>Mixed Marriages are Condemned</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Ne 13:23">23</verse-number>Also in those days I saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. <verse-number id="Ne 13:24">24</verse-number>Half of their children spoke Ashdodite and could not speak Judean, but <supplied>only</supplied> the tongues of other nations. <verse-number id="Ne 13:25">25</verse-number>So I quarreled with them and cursed them and beat some of their men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath by God: “Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves. <verse-number id="Ne 13:26">26</verse-number>Did not King Solomon of Israel sin in this way? And among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Yet the foreign women made even him sin. <verse-number id="Ne 13:27">27</verse-number>Should we listen to you all and do this great evil, acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Ne 13:28">28</verse-number>One from the sons of Jehoiada, son of the high priest Eliashib, <supplied>who was</supplied> the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonote <supplied>was there</supplied>. I chased him away from me. <verse-number id="Ne 13:29">29</verse-number>Remember them, my God, because of their defilements of the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Ne 13:30">30</verse-number>So I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established responsibilities for the priests and Levites, each in his own work, <verse-number id="Ne 13:31">31</verse-number>a contribution of the wood offering at appointed times, and for the first fruits. Remember me, my God, for good. </p>
