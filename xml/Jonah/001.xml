			<pericope>Jonah Disobeys Yahweh</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Jon 1:1">1</verse-number>And the word of Yahweh came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, <verse-number id="Jon 1:2">2</verse-number>“Get up! Go to the great city Nineveh and cry out against her, because their evil has come up <idiom-start/>before me<idiom-end/>.”<note>Literally “to my face”</note> <verse-number id="Jon 1:3">3</verse-number>But Jonah set out to flee toward Tarshish from <idiom-start/>the presence of<idiom-end/><note>Literally “from to face of”</note> Yahweh. And he went down <supplied>to</supplied> Joppa and found a merchant ship going <supplied>to</supplied> Tarshish, and paid her fare, and went on board her to go with them toward Tarshish from <idiom-start/>the presence of<idiom-end/><note>Literally “from to face of”</note> Yahweh. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jon 1:4">4</verse-number>And Yahweh hurled a great wind upon the sea, and it was a great storm on the sea, and the merchant ship <idiom-start/>was in danger of breaking up<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “threatened to be broken up”</note> <verse-number id="Jon 1:5">5</verse-number>And the mariners were afraid, and each cried out to his god. And they threw the <idiom-start/>contents<idiom-end/><note>Literally “objects”</note> that were in the merchant ship into the sea to lighten it for them. And <supplied>meanwhile</supplied> Jonah went down into the hold of the vessel and lay down and fell asleep. <verse-number id="Jon 1:6">6</verse-number>And the captain<note>Or “commander”</note> of the ship approached him and said to him, “Why are you <idiom-start/>sound asleep<idiom-end/>?<note>Literally “in a deep sleep”</note> Get up! Call on your god! Perhaps <supplied>your</supplied> god<note>Literally “the god,” with the article indicating previous reference</note> will take notice of us and we won’t perish!” <verse-number id="Jon 1:7">7</verse-number>And they said <idiom-start/>to one another<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “each to his friend/companion”</note> “Come, let us cast lots so that we may know on whose account this disaster <supplied>has come</supplied> on us!” And they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. <verse-number id="Jon 1:8">8</verse-number>So they said to him, “Please tell us whoever <supplied>is responsible that</supplied> this disaster <supplied>has come</supplied> upon us! What <supplied>is</supplied> your occupation? And from where do you come? What <supplied>is</supplied> your country? And from which people <supplied>are</supplied> you?” <verse-number id="Jon 1:9">9</verse-number>And he said to them, “I <supplied>am</supplied> a Hebrew, and I fear Yahweh, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.” <verse-number id="Jon 1:10">10</verse-number>Then the men <idiom-start/>were greatly afraid<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “were afraid with a great fear”</note> and they said to him, “What <supplied>is</supplied> this you have done?” because they<note>Literally “the men” but this is redundant in English</note> knew that he <supplied>was</supplied> fleeing <idiom-start/>from the presence of<idiom-end/><note>Literally “from before the face of”</note> Yahweh (because he had told them). <verse-number id="Jon 1:11">11</verse-number>So they said to him, “What shall we do to you so that the sea may quiet down for us?” because the sea <idiom-start/>was growing more and more tempestuous<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “going/growing and storming”</note> <verse-number id="Jon 1:12">12</verse-number>And he said to them, “Pick me up and hurl me into the sea so that the sea may quiet down for you, because I know that on account of me this great storm <supplied>has come</supplied> upon you all.” <verse-number id="Jon 1:13">13</verse-number>But the men rowed <supplied>hard</supplied> to bring <supplied>the ship</supplied><note>Here the direct object is supplied from context</note> back to the dry land, and they could not <supplied>do so</supplied> because the sea <idiom-start/>was growing more and more tempestuous<idiom-end/><note>Literally “going/growing and storming”</note> against them. <verse-number id="Jon 1:14">14</verse-number>So they cried out to Yahweh, and they said, “O Yahweh! Please do not let us perish because of this man’s life, and <idiom-start/>do not make us guilty of innocent blood<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “do not give innocent blood on us”</note> because you, O Yahweh, did what you wanted.” <verse-number id="Jon 1:15">15</verse-number>And they picked Jonah up and hurled him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging. <verse-number id="Jon 1:16">16</verse-number>So the men feared Yahweh <idiom-start/>greatly<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “with a great fear”</note> and they offered a sacrifice to Yahweh and <idiom-start/>made<idiom-end/><note>Literally “vowed”</note> vows. </p>
