			<pericope>Israel’s Appeal to Rehoboam</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Ki 12:1">1</verse-number>Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all of Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:2">2</verse-number>It happened that Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard <supplied>of it</supplied> while he was still in Egypt where he had fled from the face of King Solomon, and Jeroboam had lived in Egypt. <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:3">3</verse-number>So they sent and summoned him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came. <supplied>Then</supplied> they spoke to Rehoboam, saying, <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:4">4</verse-number>“Your father made our yoke heavy; now lighten the hard labor of your father and the heavy yoke which he placed on us, and we will serve you.” <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:5">5</verse-number>He said, “Go up for three days and then return to me”; so the people went away. </p>

			<pericope>Rehoboam Seeks Counsel to Respond</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Ki 12:6">6</verse-number>Then King Rehoboam consulted with the old men who had been <idiom-start/>serving<idiom-end/><note>Literally “standing”</note> before Solomon his father when he was alive, saying, “How <supplied>are</supplied> you advising <supplied>me</supplied> <idiom-start/>to answer this people<idiom-end/>?”<note>Literally “to return a word to this people”</note> <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:7">7</verse-number>They said to him, “If you will be a servant today to this people, then you will serve them; and if you answer them and speak good words to them, they will always be your servants.” <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:8">8</verse-number>But he rejected the advice of the old men, which they gave him, and he consulted with the youngsters who had grown up with him, who were <idiom-start/>serving<idiom-end/><note>Literally “standing”</note> before him. <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:9">9</verse-number>He said to them, “What <supplied>are</supplied> you advising that we should reply to this people who spoke to me by saying, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us.’ ” <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:10">10</verse-number>Then the youngsters who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you shall say to this people who spoke to you: ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten <supplied>it</supplied> for us,’ you shall say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins. <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:11">11</verse-number>So then, my father loaded a heavy yoke on all of you, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions!’ ” </p>

			<pericope>Rehoboam Responds Unwisely with Disastrous Results</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Ki 12:12">12</verse-number>Jeroboam and all of the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had spoken: “Return to me on the third day.” <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:13">13</verse-number>Then the king answered all the people harshly, <supplied>as</supplied> he had rejected the advice of the old men that they had offered. <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:14">14</verse-number>He spoke to them according to the advice of the youngsters, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add onto your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.” <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:15">15</verse-number>So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turning of events from Yahweh in order to fulfill his word which Yahweh had spoken through the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:16">16</verse-number>When all of Israel saw that the king would not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, “<idiom-start/>What share do we have in David<idiom-end/>?<note>Literally “What is for us a share in David”</note> <supplied>There is</supplied> no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, Israel! Now look to your house, David!” Then Israel went to their<note>Hebrew “his”</note> tents. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Ki 12:17">17</verse-number>The <idiom-start/>Israelites<idiom-end/><note>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</note> were living in the cities of Judah, and Rehoboam was reigning over them. <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:18">18</verse-number>King Rehoboam sent Adoram who <supplied>was</supplied> over the forced labor, and all of Israel cast stones at him and he died, but King Rehoboam managed to get up on the chariot to flee <supplied>to</supplied> Jerusalem. <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:19">19</verse-number>So Israel rebelled against the house of David until this day. </p>
			<p/>
			<pericope>Civil War Averted</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Ki 12:20">20</verse-number>It happened that just when all of Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all of Israel. Not one <supplied>followed</supplied> after the house of David except the tribe of Judah alone. <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:21">21</verse-number>When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all of the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand <idiom-start/>choice troops<idiom-end/><note>Literally “chosen makers of war”</note> to fight with the house of Israel, to restore the kingship to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:22">22</verse-number>Then the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:23">23</verse-number>“Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon the king of Judah and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin and the remainder of the people, saying, <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:24">24</verse-number>‘Thus says Yahweh: “You shall not go up and you shall not fight with your brothers the <idiom-start/>Israelites<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</note> Return each of you to his house, for this thing was from me.” ’ ” So they heeded the word of Yahweh, and they returned to go home according to the word of Yahweh. </p>

			<pericope>Jeroboam Becomes King over Israel</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Ki 12:25">25</verse-number>Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and he resided in it. Then he went out from there and built Penuel. <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:26">26</verse-number>Then Jeroboam <idiom-start/>said to himself<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “said to his heart”</note> “Now the kingdom will return to the house of David <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:27">27</verse-number>if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house<note>Or “temple”</note> of Yahweh in Jerusalem. The heart of this people will return to their master Rehoboam the king of Judah, and they shall kill me and <idiom-start/>return to him<idiom-end/>.”<note>Hebrew “return to Rehoboam the king of Judah”</note> </p>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Ki 12:28">28</verse-number>And the king had decided, so he made two golden calves and he said to them,<note>That is, the people</note> “<idiom-start/>You have been going up to Jerusalem long enough<idiom-end/>;<note>Literally “enough for you from going up to Jerusalem”</note> here are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.” <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:29">29</verse-number>He put one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan. <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:30">30</verse-number>This thing became a sin, and the people walked before the one as far as Dan. <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:31">31</verse-number>Then he built the houses on the high places, and he appointed priests <idiom-start/>from all walks of life<idiom-end/><note>Literally “from the fringes of the people”</note> who were not from the sons of Levi. <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:32">32</verse-number>Jeroboam also inaugurated a religious feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month, like the religious feast which was in Judah, and he offered <supplied>sacrifices</supplied> on the altar. Thus he did in Bethel, by sacrificing to the calves that he had made; and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made. <verse-number id="1 Ki 12:33">33</verse-number>He offered <supplied>sacrifices</supplied> on the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month which his heart had devised. He inaugurated a religious feast for the <idiom-start/>Israelites<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</note> and he went up to the altar to offer incense. </p>
