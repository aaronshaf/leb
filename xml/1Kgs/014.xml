			<pericope>Judgment for Jeroboam Continues</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Ki 14:1">1</verse-number>At that time, Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:2">2</verse-number>Jeroboam said to his wife, “Please get up and disguise yourself so that they will not know that you <supplied>are</supplied> the wife of Jeroboam, and go <supplied>to</supplied> Shiloh. Look, Ahijah the prophet is there, and he spoke concerning me <supplied>before I became</supplied> king over this people. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:3">3</verse-number>You must take ten loaves of bread in your hand and cakes and a jar of honey, and you must go to him. He shall tell you what will happen to the boy.” <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:4">4</verse-number>The wife of Jeroboam did so. She got up, went <supplied>to</supplied> Shiloh, and came <supplied>to</supplied> the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah was not able to see, for <idiom-start/>his eyes were fixed<idiom-end/><note>Literally “his eyes stood”</note> because of his old age. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:5">5</verse-number>Then Yahweh said to Ahijah, “Look, the wife of Jeroboam <supplied>is</supplied> coming to seek a word from you about her son, for he <supplied>is</supplied> ill. <idiom-start/>Thus and so<idiom-end/><note>Literally “As this and as this”</note> you shall say to her. When she comes, she <supplied>will be</supplied> disguising herself.” <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:6">6</verse-number>It happened at the moment Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps coming through the doorway, he said, “Come <supplied>in</supplied>, wife of Jeroboam. Why <supplied>are</supplied> you making yourself unrecognizable? I have been sent a hard <supplied>message</supplied> for you: <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:7">7</verse-number>Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: “Because I raised you from the midst of the people and I made you leader over my people Israel, <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:8">8</verse-number>I tore the kingdom from the house of David and I gave it to you. But you were not like my servant David who kept my commandments, and who went after me with all his heart, to do only <supplied>what is</supplied> right in my eyes. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:9">9</verse-number>But you did more evil than all who were before you. You have gone and made for yourself other gods and molten idols to provoke me, but me you have <idiom-start/>completely disregarded<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “hurled behind your back”</note> <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:10">10</verse-number>Therefore, look, I am about to bring disaster upon the house of Jeroboam, and I will cut off <idiom-start/>males<idiom-end/><note>Literally “those who urinate against a wall”</note> from Jeroboam, bond or free, in Israel. I will burn after the house of Jeroboam as one burns after the manure, until it is finished. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:11">11</verse-number>He who dies for Jeroboam in the city, the dogs will eat. He who dies in the open field, the birds from the heavens will eat, for Yahweh has spoken <supplied>it</supplied>.” ’ <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:12">12</verse-number>As for you, get up. Go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the child will die. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:13">13</verse-number>All of Israel will mourn for him, and they will bury him. This one alone will come to a tomb for Jeroboam, because a good thing has been found in him by Yahweh the God of Israel in the house of Israel. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:14">14</verse-number>Yahweh will raise up a king for himself over Israel who will even now cut off the house of Jeroboam this day. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:15">15</verse-number>Yahweh will strike Israel as one shakes the reed plant in the water, and he will root Israel up from this good land that he gave to their ancestors.<note>Or “fathers”</note> He will scatter them beyond the River<note>That is, the Euphrates</note> because they have made their sacred poles <supplied>which are</supplied> provoking Yahweh. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:16">16</verse-number>He will give up Israel because of the sin of Jeroboam which he sinned and which he caused Israel to sin.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Ki 14:17">17</verse-number>Then the wife of Jeroboam got up, went, and came to Tirzah. <supplied>As</supplied> she <supplied>was</supplied> coming to the threshold of the house, the boy died. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:18">18</verse-number>They buried him and all of Israel mourned for him, according to the word of Yahweh which he had spoken by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:19">19</verse-number>The remainder of the acts of Jeroboam, how he fought and how he reigned, behold, they <supplied>are</supplied> written in the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Israel. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:20">20</verse-number>The days which Jeroboam reigned were twenty-two years, and he slept with his ancestors.<note>Or “fathers”</note> Then Nadab his son became king in place of him. </p>

			<pericope>Rehoboam Reigns in Judah</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Ki 14:21">21</verse-number>Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. He was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which, from all of the tribes of Israel, Yahweh chose to place his name. And the name of his mother <supplied>was</supplied> Naamah the Ammonitess. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:22">22</verse-number>But Judah did evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and they annoyed him more than their fathers<note>Or “ancestors”</note> did with their sins that they had committed. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:23">23</verse-number>They also built for themselves high places and stone pillars and sacred poles on every high hill and under every green tree. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:24">24</verse-number>There were also male shrine prostitutes in the land, and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh had driven out from before the <idiom-start/>Israelites<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “sons/children of Israel”</note> </p>

			<pericope>Pharaoh Shishak of Egypt Raids Jerusalem</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Ki 14:25">25</verse-number>It happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:26">26</verse-number>and he took the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and he took all the treasures of the king’s house. He took the small gold shields that Solomon had made, <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:27">27</verse-number>so King Rehoboam made small copper shields in place of them and <idiom-start/>entrusted them<idiom-end/><note>Literally “he assigned on the hand”</note> to the commanders of the royal guard who keep the doorway of the king’s house. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:28">28</verse-number>Whenever the king came <supplied>to</supplied> the house of Yahweh, the royal guard carried them and brought them back to the alcove room of the royal guard. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:29">29</verse-number>The remainder of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did, are they not written on the scroll of the events of the days of the kings of Judah? <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:30">30</verse-number>There was always war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. <verse-number id="1 Ki 14:31">31</verse-number>Then Rehoboam slept with his ancestors,<note>Or “fathers”</note> and he was buried with his ancestors<note>Or “fathers”</note> in the city of David. The name of his mother <supplied>was</supplied> Naamah the Ammonitess. Abijam his son became king in his place. </p>
