			<pericope>Imitators of God</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Eph 5:1">1</verse-number> Therefore become imitators of God, as beloved children, <verse-number id="Eph 5:2">2</verse-number>and live in love, just as also Christ loved us, and gave himself for us an offering and sacrifice to God for a fragrant smell.<note>Or “a fragrant offering”</note> <verse-number id="Eph 5:3">3</verse-number>But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or greediness, must not even be named among you (as is fitting for saints), <verse-number id="Eph 5:4">4</verse-number>and obscenity, and foolish talk, or coarse jesting (which <supplied>are</supplied> not proper), but rather thanksgiving. <verse-number id="Eph 5:5">5</verse-number>For this you know <idiom-start/>for certain<idiom-end/><note>Literally “for this you know, knowing”</note>, that every sexually immoral <supplied>person</supplied>, or unclean <supplied>person</supplied>, or greedy <supplied>person</supplied> (who is an idolater), does not have an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. <verse-number id="Eph 5:6">6</verse-number>Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these <supplied>things</supplied> the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience. </p>

			<pericope>Walk Like Children of Light</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Eph 5:7">7</verse-number>Therefore do not be sharers<note>Or “partners”</note> with them, <verse-number id="Eph 5:8">8</verse-number>for you were formerly darkness, but now <supplied>you are</supplied> light in the Lord. Live like children of light <verse-number id="Eph 5:9">9</verse-number>(for the fruit of the light <supplied>is</supplied> in all goodness and righteousness and truth), <verse-number id="Eph 5:10">10</verse-number>trying to learn what is well-pleasing to the Lord. <verse-number id="Eph 5:11">11</verse-number>And do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather even expose <supplied>them</supplied>. <verse-number id="Eph 5:12">12</verse-number>For it is shameful even to speak <supplied>about</supplied> the things being <supplied>done</supplied> by them in secret, <verse-number id="Eph 5:13">13</verse-number>but all <supplied>things</supplied> exposed by the light are made visible, <verse-number id="Eph 5:14">14</verse-number>for everything made visible is light. Therefore it says, </p>

			<p><verse-number id="Eph 5:15">15</verse-number>Therefore, consider carefully how you live, not as unwise but as wise, <verse-number id="Eph 5:16">16</verse-number>making the most of the time because the days are evil. </p>

			<pericope>Being Filled by the Spirit</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Eph 5:17">17</verse-number>Because of this do not become foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord <supplied>is</supplied>. <verse-number id="Eph 5:18">18</verse-number>And do not be drunk with wine (in which is dissipation), but be filled by the Spirit, <verse-number id="Eph 5:19">19</verse-number>speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and singing praise in your heart to the Lord, <verse-number id="Eph 5:20">20</verse-number>giving thanks always for all <supplied>things</supplied> in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to the God and Father, <verse-number id="Eph 5:21">21</verse-number>being subject to one another <idiom-start/>out of reverence for<idiom-end/><note>Literally “in <supplied>the</supplied> fear of”</note> Christ <verse-number id="Eph 5:22">22</verse-number>—wives to their own husbands as to the Lord, <verse-number id="Eph 5:23">23</verse-number>because <supplied>the</supplied> husband is <supplied>the</supplied> head of the wife, as also Christ <supplied>is the</supplied> head of the church (he himself <supplied>being the</supplied> Savior of the body). <verse-number id="Eph 5:24">24</verse-number>But as the church is subject to Christ, thus also wives <supplied>should be subject</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*The words “should be subject” are not in the Greek text, but are an understood repetition from the previous clause</note> to their husbands in everything. </p>

			<pericope>Husbands and Wives</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Eph 5:25">25</verse-number>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for her; <verse-number id="Eph 5:26">26</verse-number>in order that he might sanctify her by cleansing <supplied>her</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> with the washing of water by the word; <verse-number id="Eph 5:27">27</verse-number>in order that he might present to himself the church glorious, not having a spot or wrinkle or any such <supplied>thing</supplied>, but that she may be holy and blameless. <verse-number id="Eph 5:28">28</verse-number>Thus also husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. The one who loves his own wife loves himself. <verse-number id="Eph 5:29">29</verse-number>For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as also Christ <supplied>does</supplied> the church, <verse-number id="Eph 5:30">30</verse-number>because we are members of his body. <verse-number id="Eph 5:31">31</verse-number>“For this <supplied>reason</supplied> a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Ge 2:24">Gen 2:24</cite></note> <verse-number id="Eph 5:32">32</verse-number>(This mystery is great, but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.) <verse-number id="Eph 5:33">33</verse-number>Only you also, each one <supplied>of you</supplied>, must thus love his own wife as himself, and the wife <idiom-start/>must respect<idiom-end/><note>Literally “that she fear”</note> her husband. </p>
