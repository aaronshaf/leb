				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:1">1</verse-number>How desolate the city sits </li1>
				<li2><supplied>that</supplied> was full of people! </li2>
				<li1>She has become like a widow, </li1>
				<li2><supplied>once</supplied> great among the nations! </li2>
				<li1>Like a woman of nobility in the provinces, </li1>
				<li2>she has become a forced laborer. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:2">2</verse-number>She weeps bitterly in the night, </li1>
				<li2>her tears <supplied>are</supplied> on her cheeks; </li2>
				<li1>she has no comforter </li1>
				<li2>among all her lovers. </li2>
				<li1>All her friends have been unfaithful to her; </li1>
				<li2>they have become her enemies. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:3">3</verse-number>Judah has gone into exile with misery </li1>
				<li2>and under hard servitude; </li2>
				<li1>she lives among the nations, </li1>
				<li2>she has not found a resting place; </li2>
				<li1>all her pursuers have overtaken her </li1>
				<li2>amidst <supplied>her</supplied> distress. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:4">4</verse-number>The roads of Zion <supplied>are</supplied> mourning </li1>
				<li2>because no one comes to the festival. </li2>
				<li1>All her gates <supplied>are</supplied> desolate, </li1>
				<li2>her priests groan; </li2>
				<li1>her young women <supplied>are</supplied> worried, </li1>
				<li2>and she herself suffers bitterly. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:5">5</verse-number>Her foes have become <supplied>her</supplied> <idiom-start/>master<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “head”</note> </li1>
				<li2>her enemies are at ease; </li2>
				<li1>Yahweh has made her suffer </li1>
				<li2>because of the greatness of her transgressions. </li2>
				<li1>Her children have gone away, </li1>
				<li2>captive before the foe. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:6">6</verse-number>All her majesty has gone away </li1>
				<li2>from the daughter of Zion; </li2>
				<li1>her princes have become like young stags </li1>
				<li2>that have not found pasture; </li2>
				<li1>they have gone away without strength, </li1>
				<li2>before the pursuer. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:7">7</verse-number>Jerusalem remembers </li1>
				<li2>the days of her misery and wanderings, </li2>
				<li1>all her treasures </li1>
				<li2>that were from the days of long ago. </li2>
				<li1>When her people fell into <supplied>the</supplied> hand of the enemy, </li1>
				<li2>there was no one helping her; </li2>
				<li1>the enemies saw her, they mocked </li1>
				<li2>at her destruction. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:8">8</verse-number>Jerusalem sinned grievously, </li1>
				<li2>thus she became an objection of derision; </li2>
				<li1>all those who honored her despise her </li1>
				<li2>because they have seen her nakedness. </li2>
				<li1>She herself groans </li1>
				<li2>and turns away. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:9">9</verse-number>Her uncleanness <supplied>was</supplied> in her skirts; </li1>
				<li2>she did not remember her future, </li2>
				<li1>she has descended beyond understanding, </li1>
				<li2>there is no comforter for her. </li2>
				<li1>See, O Yahweh, my persecution! </li1>
				<li2><supplied>My</supplied> enemy has been made great! </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:10">10</verse-number>The enemy has stretched out his hand </li1>
				<li2>over all her treasures; </li2>
				<li1>for she has seen the nations, </li1>
				<li2>they entered her sanctuary, </li2>
				<li1>those whom you commanded not to enter </li1>
				<li2>in your assembly. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:11">11</verse-number>All her people groan, </li1>
				<li2>they are searching for bread. </li2>
				<li1>They give their treasures for food, </li1>
				<li2>to bring back life. </li2>
				<li1>See, O Yahweh, and look, </li1>
				<li2><supplied>how</supplied> I am despised. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:12">12</verse-number>Is it nothing to you, <idiom-start/>all who pass by<idiom-end/>?<note>Literally “all who cross a road”</note> </li1>
				<li2>Look and see </li2>
				<li1>if there is sorrow like my sorrow,<note>Or “pain like my pain”</note> </li1>
				<li2>which was dealt to me, </li2>
				<li1>which Yahweh inflicted </li1>
				<li2>on the <idiom-start/>day of his wrath<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “on the day of the blaze of his nose”</note> </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:13">13</verse-number>From heaven he sent fire, </li1>
				<li2>into my bones he let it descend. </li2>
				<li1>He spread out a net for my feet; </li1>
				<li2>he turned me back, </li2>
				<li1>he gave me devastation, </li1>
				<li2>fainting all day. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:14">14</verse-number>My rebellion was bound <supplied>as</supplied> a yoke, </li1>
				<li2>with his hand it was fastened together; </li2>
				<li1>it was put on my neck </li1>
				<li2><supplied>and</supplied> caused my strength to fail. </li2>
				<li1>The Lord gave me into the hands </li1>
				<li2><supplied>of those whom</supplied> I cannot withstand. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:15">15</verse-number>The Lord has rejected </li1>
				<li2>all my mighty ones in my midst. </li2>
				<li1>He called an assembly against me, </li1>
				<li2>to crush my young men; </li2>
				<li1><supplied>like in</supplied> a wine press, </li1>
				<li2>the Lord has trodden <supplied>on</supplied> </li2>
				<li1>the virgin daughter of Judah. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:16">16</verse-number>For these <supplied>things</supplied>, I am weeping, </li1>
				<li2><idiom-start/>my eyes flow with tears<idiom-end/>;<note>Literally “my eye my eye is going down <supplied>with</supplied> water”</note> </li2>
				<li1>because a comforter is far from me, </li1>
				<li2>one to restore my life. </li2>
				<li1>My sons are desolate </li1>
				<li2>because <supplied>the</supplied> enemy has prevailed. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:17">17</verse-number>Zion stretches out her hands; </li1>
				<li2>there is no one to comfort her. </li2>
				<li1>Yahweh has commanded against Jacob, </li1>
				<li2><supplied>that</supplied> those surrounding him<note>NRSV translates “his neighbors”</note> <supplied>should be</supplied> his enemies; </li2>
				<li1>Jerusalem has become </li1>
				<li2>a defilement among them. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:18">18</verse-number>Yahweh is righteous; </li1>
				<li2>I have rebelled <supplied>against</supplied> <idiom-start/>his word<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “his mouth”</note> </li2>
				<li1>Please hear, all <supplied>the</supplied> nations, </li1>
				<li2>And see my pain; </li2>
				<li1>My young women<note>Or “virgins”</note> and young men </li1>
				<li2>went into captivity. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:19">19</verse-number>I have called to my lovers, </li1>
				<li2>they themselves deceived me; </li2>
				<li1>my priests and elders perished in the city </li1>
				<li2>when they sought food for themselves </li2>
				<li3>to revive their life.<note>Or “their soul”</note> </li3>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:20">20</verse-number>See, O Yahweh, that <idiom-start/>I am in distress<idiom-end/>;<note>Literally “<supplied>there is</supplied> distress for me”</note> </li1>
				<li2><idiom-start/>my stomach<idiom-end/><note>Literally “inner parts”</note> is in torment, </li2>
				<li1>my heart has turned inside me </li1>
				<li2>because I have certainly rebelled. </li2>
				<li1>From outside a sword brings bereavement, </li1>
				<li2>inside the house <supplied>it is</supplied> like death. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:21">21</verse-number>They hear that I was groaning; </li1>
				<li2><supplied>there is</supplied> no comforter for me. </li2>
				<li1>All my enemies have heard my misery, </li1>
				<li2>they are pleased that you have done it. </li2>
				<li1>Bring <supplied>that</supplied> day that you have proclaimed,<note>Or “you have called”</note> </li1>
				<li2>And let them be like me. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 1:22">22</verse-number>Let all their evil come before you; </li1>
				<li2>and deal with them </li2>
				<li1>just as you have dealt with me </li1>
				<li2>because of all my crimes; </li2>
				<li1>for my groaning is much and my heart <supplied>is</supplied> faint. </li1>
