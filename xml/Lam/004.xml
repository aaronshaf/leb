				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:1">1</verse-number>How <supplied>the</supplied> gold has grown dim, </li1>
				<li1>the pure gold has changed. </li1>
				<li1>The stones of holiness are scattered </li1>
				<li2>at the head of every street. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:2">2</verse-number>The precious sons of Zion </li1>
				<li2>weighed against fine gold, </li2>
				<li1>how they are thought of as earthen vessels of clay, </li1>
				<li2>the work of the potter’s hands. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:3">3</verse-number>Even the jackal bears the beast </li1>
				<li2>and nurses their cubs; </li2>
				<li1><supplied>but</supplied> the daughter of my people has become ruthless, </li1>
				<li2>like ostriches in the wilderness. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:4">4</verse-number>The tongue of the nursling cleaves </li1>
				<li2>to its palate in thirst. </li2>
				<li1>Children beg <supplied>for</supplied> food, </li1>
				<li2><idiom-start/>no one lays it out before them<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “nothing spreads to them”</note> </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:5">5</verse-number>The ones who eat delicacies, </li1>
				<li2>they are ruined in the streets; </li2>
				<li1>the ones nurtured in purple </li1>
				<li2>lie <supplied>on</supplied> piles of trash. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:6">6</verse-number>The iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater </li1>
				<li2>than the sin of Sodom; </li2>
				<li1>it was overthrown in a moment </li1>
				<li2>and no hands were laid on her. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:7">7</verse-number>Her princes were purer than snow, </li1>
				<li2>they were whiter than milk; </li2>
				<li1><supplied>their</supplied> bodies were more ruddy than rubies, </li1>
				<li2>sapphire their appearance. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:8">8</verse-number><supplied>Now</supplied> their appearance is blacker than soot, </li1>
				<li2>they are not recognized in the streets; </li2>
				<li1>their skin has shriveled on their bones, </li1>
				<li2>it has become dry like wood. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:9">9</verse-number>Happier were <supplied>the</supplied> victims of <supplied>the</supplied> sword </li1>
				<li2>than the victims of famine; </li2>
				<li1>they have pined away, very hungry </li1>
				<li2>for the crops of my field. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:10">10</verse-number><supplied>The</supplied> hands of compassionate women, </li1>
				<li2>have cooked their children; </li2>
				<li1>they became as something to eat </li1>
				<li2>in the destruction of the daughter of my people. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:11">11</verse-number>Yahweh has completed his anger, </li1>
				<li2>he has poured out <idiom-start/>his fierce anger<idiom-end/>;<note>Literally “the fierce anger of his nose”</note> </li2>
				<li1>he has kindled a fire in Zion, </li1>
				<li2>it consumed her<note>Or “its”</note> foundations. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:12">12</verse-number><supplied>The</supplied> kings of <supplied>the</supplied> earth did not believe, </li1>
				<li2>and all <supplied>the</supplied> inhabitants of <supplied>the</supplied> world, </li2>
				<li1>that a foe and an enemy could enter </li1>
				<li2>into the gates of Jerusalem. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:13">13</verse-number>Because of the sins of her prophets, </li1>
				<li2>the guilt of her priests, </li2>
				<li1>who shed blood in her midst, </li1>
				<li2>of righteous people. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:14">14</verse-number>They wander blindly in the streets; </li1>
				<li2>they were defiled with the blood, </li2>
				<li1>their clothes </li1>
				<li2>could not be touched. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:15">15</verse-number>“Go away! Defiled!” they shout to them. </li1>
				<li2>“Go away! Go away! Do not touch!” </li2>
				<li1>so they left, they left; it was said among the nations, </li1>
				<li2>“<idiom-start/>They will no longer dwell with us<idiom-end/>.”<note>Literally “They will no longer be <supplied>here</supplied> as aliens”</note> </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:16">16</verse-number>The presence of Yahweh has scattered them, </li1>
				<li2>he will no longer watch over them; </li2>
				<li1><idiom-start/>they did not honor the priests<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “they did not lift up the faces of the priests”</note> </li1>
				<li2>they did not show mercy <supplied>to</supplied> elders. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:17">17</verse-number>Still our eyes failed, </li1>
				<li2><supplied>looking for</supplied> our help in vain; </li2>
				<li1>in our watchtower, we kept watch </li1>
				<li2>for a nation that could not save. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:18">18</verse-number>They hunted our steps, </li1>
				<li2>from walking in our streets; </li2>
				<li1>our end has come near, <idiom-start/>our days are finished<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “our days are filled”</note> </li1>
				<li2>our end has come. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:19">19</verse-number>Our pursuers were swifter </li1>
				<li2>than <supplied>the</supplied> eagles of <supplied>the</supplied> heavens; </li2>
				<li1>they chased us on the mountains, </li1>
				<li2>they have set an ambush for us in the desert. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:20">20</verse-number>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed one of Yahweh, </li1>
				<li2>was captured in their pits; </li2>
				<li1>of whom we said, “In his shadow </li1>
				<li2>we will live among the nations.” </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:21">21</verse-number>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, </li1>
				<li2>you who dwell in the land of Uz; </li2>
				<li1>but to you also the cup will pass, </li1>
				<li2>you will become drunk and strip yourself bare. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="La 4:22">22</verse-number>The <supplied>punishment</supplied> of your iniquity is completed, O daughter of Zion, </li1>
				<li2>your exile will not continue; </li2>
				<li1><supplied>but</supplied> he will punish your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, </li1>
				<li2>he will reveal your sins. </li2>
