			<pericope>Jehu Anointed Prophetically to Rule in Place of Joram of Israel</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ki 9:1">1</verse-number>Now Elisha the prophet called for one of the sons of the prophets, and he said to him, “Gird your loins, and take this flask of olive oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-Gilead. <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:2">2</verse-number>Go there and look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi. Go, for you must cause him to arise from among his brothers, and you must bring him into an <idiom-start/>inner room<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “inner room of the inner room”</note> <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:3">3</verse-number>You must take the flask of olive oil and pour it out on his head. You must say, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “I hereby anoint you as king over Israel.” ’ Then you must open the door and flee; do not linger!” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ki 9:4">4</verse-number>So the young man, servant of the prophet, went <supplied>to</supplied> Ramoth-Gilead. <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:5">5</verse-number>He came, and look, the commanders of the army <supplied>were</supplied> sitting <supplied>there</supplied>. He said, “I have a word for you, O commander!” Jehu said, “For whom? For all of us?” And he said, “For you, O commander!” <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:6">6</verse-number>He got up and went to the house, and poured the olive oil on his head and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘I hereby anoint you as king over the people of Yahweh, over Israel. <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:7">7</verse-number>You will destroy the house of Ahab your master, and you will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all of the servants of Yahweh, from the hand of Jezebel. <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:8">8</verse-number>All of the house of Ahab will perish, and I shall cut off <idiom-start/>all males<idiom-end/><note>Literally “the one who urinates against a wall”</note> from Ahab, both bond and free. <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:9">9</verse-number>I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah. <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:10">10</verse-number>The dogs will eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and there shall not be <idiom-start/>anyone to bury her<idiom-end/>.’ ”<note>Literally “burying”</note> Then he opened the door and fled. </p>

			<pericope>Jehu Assassinates Joram</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ki 9:11">11</verse-number>Then Jehu came out to the officers of his master, and they said to him, “Peace? Why did this madman come to you?” And he said to them, “You know the man and his foolish talk.” <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:12">12</verse-number>Then they said, “Liar. Please tell us.” He said, “<idiom-start/>Thus and so<idiom-end/><note>Literally “As this and as this”</note> he said to me, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “I hereby anoint you as king over Israel.” ’ ” <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:13">13</verse-number>So they hastened each one to take his cloak, and they spread <supplied>them</supplied> under him on the bare steps, blew on the trumpet, and said, “Jehu is king!” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ki 9:14">14</verse-number>So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. Now Joram was keeping guard in Ramoth-Gilead, he and all of Israel, because of the <idiom-start/>threat<idiom-end/><note>Literally “from the face/presence of”</note> of Hazael king of Aram. <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:15">15</verse-number>But Joram the king had returned to heal in Jezreel from the wound which the Arameans had inflicted on him when he fought with Hazael king of Aram. Jehu said, “<idiom-start/>If this is what you want<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “If there is your soul”</note> do not let him go out as a fugitive from the city to go to make it known in Jezreel.” <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:16">16</verse-number>Jehu mounted his chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram <supplied>was</supplied> lying there, and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to visit Joram. <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:17">17</verse-number>Now the watchman <supplied>was</supplied> standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu when he came, and he said, “I see a company.” Joram said, “Take a horseman and send <supplied>him</supplied> to meet them.” And he said, “Is it peace?” <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:18">18</verse-number>So the rider of the horse went out to meet him, and he said, “Thus the king asks, ‘Is it peace?’ ” Then Jehu said, “<idiom-start/>What do you have to do with peace<idiom-end/>?<note>Literally “What is for you and for peace”</note> Turn after me.” Then the watchman reported, saying, “The messenger went up to them, but he did not return.” <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:19">19</verse-number>Then he sent out a second horseman, and he came to them and said, “Thus the king asks, ‘Is it peace?’ ” Then Jehu said, “<idiom-start/>What do you have to do with peace<idiom-end/>?<note>Literally “What is for you and for peace”</note> Turn after me.” <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:20">20</verse-number>So the sentinel reported, saying, “He went up to them, but he did not return, and the driving <supplied>is</supplied> like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives with madness.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ki 9:21">21</verse-number>Then Joram said, “Get ready,” so he got his chariot ready. Joram king of Israel went out, and Ahaziah king of Judah, each with his chariot. They went out to meet Jehu, and they found him at the tract of land of Naboth the Jezreelite. <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:22">22</verse-number>When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, “<supplied>Is it</supplied> peace?” And he said, “What peace <supplied>is there</supplied> while the prostitutions of your mother Jezebel and her sorceries are numerous?” <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:23">23</verse-number>Joram turned his <idiom-start/>chariot<idiom-end/><note>Literally “hand”</note> and fled and said to Ahaziah, “It’s treason, Ahaziah!” <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:24">24</verse-number>Then Jehu <idiom-start/>drew his bow<idiom-end/><note>Literally “filled his hand with the bow”</note> and shot Joram between his shoulders so that the arrow went out from his heart, and he slumped down in his chariot. <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:25">25</verse-number>He said to Bidkar his third <supplied>servant</supplied>, “Lift <supplied>him</supplied> out and throw him on the plot of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite, for remember, you and I <supplied>were</supplied> with the pair <supplied>of chariots</supplied> behind Ahab his father when Yahweh pronounced this oracle against him: <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:26">26</verse-number>‘ “Since I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his children yesterday,” declares Yahweh, “I will requite it for you in this tract of land,” declares Yahweh.’ So then lift him out and throw him on the tract of land according to the word of Yahweh.” </p>

			<pericope>Jehu Orders the Assassination of Ahaziah</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ki 9:27">27</verse-number>When Ahaziah king of Judah saw, he fled the way of Beth-Haggen. Jehu pursued after him and said, “Shoot him also, in the chariot.” <supplied>They shot him</supplied> at the ascent of Gur which <supplied>is</supplied> in Ibleam, and he fled <supplied>to</supplied> Megiddo, but he died there. <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:28">28</verse-number>Then his officers carried him to Jerusalem, and they buried him in his tomb with his ancestors<note>Or “fathers”</note> in the city of David. <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:29">29</verse-number>In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah. </p>

			<pericope>Jezebel Loses Her High Position</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ki 9:30">30</verse-number>When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard <supplied>of it</supplied>, so she painted her eyes with black eye paint and adorned her head and looked through the window. <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:31">31</verse-number>Now Jehu had come in the gate, so she said, “<supplied>Is it</supplied> peace, O Zimri, murderer of his master?” <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:32">32</verse-number>When he lifted up his face to the window, he asked, “Who <supplied>is</supplied> with me?” Two or three eunuchs looked down to him. <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:33">33</verse-number>So he said, “Throw her down.” So they threw her down, and her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and they trampled her. <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:34">34</verse-number>Then he came and ate and drank, and said, “Please take care of this cursed one and bury her, for she is the daughter of a king.” <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:35">35</verse-number>When they went to bury her, they could not find her, except the skull, the feet, and the palms of the hands. <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:36">36</verse-number>They returned and told him, and he said, “This <supplied>is</supplied> the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ‘On the plot of ground of Jezreel, the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel.’ ” <verse-number id="2 Ki 9:37">37</verse-number>So the dead body of Jezebel became dung on the surface <supplied>spread</supplied> on the field in the plot of ground of Jezreel, so one cannot say, “This <supplied>is</supplied> Jezebel.” </p>
