			<p><verse-number id="2 Ki 6:1">1</verse-number>Then the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “Please look; the place where we are living before you <supplied>is</supplied> too cramped for us. <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:2">2</verse-number>Let us please go to the Jordan and each bring from there one log that we might make a place there for us to live.” Then he said, “Do so.” <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:3">3</verse-number>Then a certain one said, “Please be prepared and go with your servants,” and he said, “I will go.” <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:4">4</verse-number>He went with them, and they went to the Jordan, and they cut down the trees. <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:5">5</verse-number>It happened as the one <supplied>was</supplied> felling the log, that the iron ax fell into the water.

			<pericope>Arameans Plot to Take Elisha</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ki 6:8">8</verse-number>The king of Aram was fighting with Israel, so he consulted with his officers, saying, “My camp is <idiom-start/>at such and such a place<idiom-end/>.”<note>Literally “to a place a certain someone”</note> <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:9">9</verse-number>Then the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, “Take care while crossing over to this place, because <supplied>the</supplied> Arameans <supplied>are</supplied> descending there.” <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:10">10</verse-number>So the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God said to him and warned him, so he was on guard there <idiom-start/>continually<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “not once or twice”</note> </p>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ki 6:11">11</verse-number>Then the heart of the king of Aram was stormy because of this matter, so he called his servants and said to them, “Can you not tell me <idiom-start/>who among us sides with the king of Israel<idiom-end/>?”<note>Literally “who from of us to the king of Israel”</note> <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:12">12</verse-number>Then one of his servants said, “No, my lord the king, but Elisha the prophet who is <supplied>in</supplied> Israel tells the king of Israel things which you speak <idiom-start/>in your own bedchamber<idiom-end/>.”<note>Literally “in the private room of your bed”</note> <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:13">13</verse-number>Then he said, “Go and see where he <supplied>is</supplied> so that I can send and capture him.” Then he was told to him, “Look, <supplied>he is</supplied> in Dothan.” <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:14">14</verse-number>So he sent horses, chariots, and an oppressing army there. They arrived at night and surrounded the town. <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:15">15</verse-number>The attendant of the man of God arose early and went out, and look, the army <supplied>was</supplied> surrounding the city with horses and chariots. His servant said to him, “Oh no, my master! What shall we do?” <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:16">16</verse-number>And he said, “Don’t be afraid, for more <supplied>are</supplied> with us than are with them.” <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:17">17</verse-number>Then Elisha prayed and said, “O Yahweh, please open his eyes that he may see,” and Yahweh opened the eyes of the servant, and he saw, and look, the mountain <supplied>was</supplied> full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha. <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:18">18</verse-number>They came down to him, and Elisha prayed to Yahweh and said, “Please strike this people with blindness,” so he struck them with blindness as <idiom-start/>Elisha had spoken<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “according to the word of Elisha”</note> <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:19">19</verse-number>Then Elisha said to them, “This <supplied>is</supplied> not the way and this <supplied>is</supplied> not the city. Come after me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” Then he brought them to Samaria. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ki 6:20">20</verse-number>It happened at the moment they came to Samaria, Elisha said, “O Yahweh, open the eyes of these that they may see,” so Yahweh opened their eyes, and they saw, and look, the middle of Samaria! <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:21">21</verse-number>Then the king of Israel said to Elisha when he saw them, “Shall I kill them? Shall I kill, my father?” <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:22">22</verse-number>And he said, “You shall not kill. Would you kill <supplied>those</supplied> whom you took captive with the sword or with the bow? Put food and water before them that they may eat and drink and then go to their master.” <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:23">23</verse-number>So he made a great feast for them, and they ate and drank; then he sent them, and they went to their master. And the bands of the Arameans did not come again into the land of Israel. </p>

			<pericope>Besieged Samaria Resorts to Cannibalism</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="2 Ki 6:24">24</verse-number>It happened after this that Ben-Hadad king of Aram assembled all of his army and marched up and laid siege against Samaria. <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:25">25</verse-number>There was a great famine in Samaria, and behold, a siege <supplied>was</supplied> against it, until the head of a donkey <supplied>went</supplied> for eighty shekels of silver, and one fourth of the measure of the dung of doves <supplied>went</supplied> for five shekels of silver. <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:26">26</verse-number>It happened that the king of Israel <supplied>was</supplied> crossing over on the wall, and a woman called out to him, saying, “Help, my lord the king!” <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:27">27</verse-number>He said, “No, let Yahweh help you. <idiom-start/>How<idiom-end/><note>Literally “From where”</note> can I save you? From the threshing floor or from the wine press?” <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:28">28</verse-number>The king said to her, “<idiom-start/>What is the problem<idiom-end/>?”<note>Literally “What is for you”</note> Then the woman said, “This woman said to me, ‘Give me your son, and let us eat him today, then tomorrow we will eat my son.’ <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:29">29</verse-number>So we cooked my son and ate him, and I said to her the next day, ‘Give your son that we may eat him.’ But she had hidden her son.” <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:30">30</verse-number>It happened that when the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes. Now he had been walking on the wall, and the people saw, and behold, sackcloth was over his flesh underneath. <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:31">31</verse-number>Then he said, “May God do to me and thus may he add, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today!” <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:32">32</verse-number>Now Elisha <supplied>was</supplied> sitting in his house and the elders <supplied>were</supplied> sitting with him, and <supplied>the king</supplied> dispatched a man from before him, but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, “Did you see that this son of a murderer has sent to remove my head? Look, when the messenger comes, close the door; and you must <idiom-start/>hold the door closed against him<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “hold him close against the door”</note> <supplied>Is</supplied> not the sound of the feet of his master behind him?” <verse-number id="2 Ki 6:33">33</verse-number>While he <supplied>was</supplied> still speaking with them, suddenly the messenger <supplied>was</supplied> coming down to him, and he said, “Look this trouble <supplied>is</supplied> from Yahweh. Why should I wait for Yahweh any longer?” </p>
