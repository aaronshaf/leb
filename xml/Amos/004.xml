You will be dragged off toward Harmon,”<note>The meaning of this Hebrew word is uncertain</note> <idiom-start/>declares<idiom-end/><note>Literally “a declaration of”</note> Yahweh. <verse-number id="Am 4:4">4</verse-number>“Come <supplied>to</supplied> Bethel and transgress; <supplied>to</supplied> Gilgal and <idiom-start/>multiply transgression<idiom-end/>!<note>Literally “increase to transgress”</note> Bring your sacrifices in the morning and your tithes on the <idiom-start/>third day<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “for three of days”</note> <verse-number id="Am 4:5">5</verse-number>And bring a thank offering of unleavened bread, and proclaim freewill offerings, pronounce them, for so you love <supplied>to do</supplied>, O <idiom-start/>people<idiom-end/><note>Literally “children”</note> of Israel,” <supplied>is</supplied> the declaration of my Lord Yahweh. <verse-number id="Am 4:6">6</verse-number>“And I<note>Emphatic use of personal pronoun</note> in turn gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities and lack of bread in all your places.
