			<pericope>A Basket of Ripe Fruit</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Am 8:1">1</verse-number>My Lord Yahweh showed me this, and there was a basket of summer fruit. <verse-number id="Am 8:2">2</verse-number>And he said, “What do you see, Amos?” And I said, “A basket of summer fruit.” And Yahweh said to me, “The end has come upon my people Israel. I will not pass by them again!” <verse-number id="Am 8:3">3</verse-number>“And the songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day,” <idiom-start/>declares<idiom-end/><note>Literally “a declaration of”</note> my Lord Yahweh. “The corpses are numerous; he throws them in every place. Be quiet!” <verse-number id="Am 8:4">4</verse-number>Hear this, those who trample on <supplied>the</supplied> poor and who annihilate the afflicted of <supplied>the</supplied> land, <verse-number id="Am 8:5">5</verse-number>saying, “When will the new moon be over, so that we can sell grain? And the Sabbath, so that we can open the grain bins, that we can make <supplied>the</supplied> ephah small and make <supplied>the</supplied> shekel large, and can practice deceit <supplied>with</supplied> a set of scales of deceit? <verse-number id="Am 8:6">6</verse-number><idiom-start/>That we can<idiom-end/><note>Literally “to buy”</note> buy <supplied>the</supplied> powerless with silver and <supplied>the</supplied> poor for the sake of a pair of sandals, and we can sell the waste of the grain?” <verse-number id="Am 8:7">7</verse-number>Yahweh has sworn by the pride of Jacob, “Surely I will never forget any of their deeds! <verse-number id="Am 8:8">8</verse-number>On account of this, will not the land tremble and will not every living <supplied>thing</supplied> in it mourn? And all of it will rise like the Nile and it will be tossed about and subside like the Nile of Egypt. <verse-number id="Am 8:9">9</verse-number>And then in that day,” <idiom-start/>declares<idiom-end/><note>Literally “a declaration of”</note> my Lord Yahweh, “I<note>Literally “and I”</note> will make the sun go down at noon and I will darken the land on a day of light. <verse-number id="Am 8:10">10</verse-number>And I will turn your feasts into mourning and all of your songs into lament, and I will put sackcloth on all loins and baldness on every head. And I will make it like the mourning for an only child, and its end like a bitter day. <verse-number id="Am 8:11">11</verse-number>Look, the days are coming,” <idiom-start/>declares<idiom-end/><note>Literally “a declaration of”</note> my Lord Yahweh, “when I will send a famine in the land, not a famine for bread and not a thirst for water, but <idiom-start/>of hearing<idiom-end/><note>Literally “but if to hear”</note> the words of Yahweh! <verse-number id="Am 8:12">12</verse-number>And they will wander from sea to sea and from <supplied>the</supplied> north and to <supplied>the</supplied> east. They will roam about to seek the word of Yahweh, but they will not find <supplied>it</supplied>! <verse-number id="Am 8:13">13</verse-number>In that day the beautiful young women and the young men will faint because of thirst. <verse-number id="Am 8:14">14</verse-number><supplied>These are</supplied> those who swear by the guilt of Samaria and say, ‘By the life of your gods, O Dan,’ and ‘By the life of the way of Beersheba,’ they will fall and they will not rise again.” </p>
