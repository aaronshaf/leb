			<pericope>Instructions About Widows</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Ti 5:1">1</verse-number> Do not rebuke an older man, but appeal to <supplied>him</supplied> as a father, younger men as brothers, <verse-number id="1 Ti 5:2">2</verse-number>older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, with all purity. <verse-number id="1 Ti 5:3">3</verse-number>Honor widows <supplied>who are</supplied> truly widows. <verse-number id="1 Ti 5:4">4</verse-number>But if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must learn to show profound respect for their own household first, and to pay back recompense to their parents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God. <verse-number id="1 Ti 5:5">5</verse-number>But the widow <supplied>who is one</supplied> truly, and is left alone, has put her hope in God and continues in her petitions and prayers night and day. <verse-number id="1 Ti 5:6">6</verse-number>But the one who lives for sensual pleasure is dead <supplied>even though she</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>even though</supplied>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“lives”) which is understood as concessive</note> lives. <verse-number id="1 Ti 5:7">7</verse-number>And command these <supplied>things</supplied>, in order that they may be irreproachable. <verse-number id="1 Ti 5:8">8</verse-number>But if someone does not provide for his own <supplied>relatives</supplied>, and especially the members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. </p>

			<pericope>Honoring Worthy Elders and Dealing With Sinners</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="1 Ti 5:17">17</verse-number>The elders who lead well must be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor by speaking and teaching. <verse-number id="1 Ti 5:18">18</verse-number>For the scripture says, “You must not muzzle an ox <supplied>while it</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>while</supplied>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“threshing”) which is understood as temporal</note> is threshing,”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Dt 25:4">Deut 25:4</cite></note> and “The worker <supplied>is</supplied> worthy of his wages.”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Lk 10:7">Luke 10:7</cite></note> <verse-number id="1 Ti 5:19">19</verse-number>Do not accept an accusation against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses. <verse-number id="1 Ti 5:20">20</verse-number>Reprove those who sin in the presence of all, in order that the rest also may experience fear. <verse-number id="1 Ti 5:21">21</verse-number>I testify solemnly before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels that you observe these <supplied>things</supplied> without prejudice, doing nothing according to partiality. <verse-number id="1 Ti 5:22">22</verse-number>Lay hands on no one hastily, and do not participate in the sins of others.
