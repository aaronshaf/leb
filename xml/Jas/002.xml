			<pericope>Partiality Forbidden</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Jas 2:1">1</verse-number> My brothers, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with partiality. <verse-number id="Jas 2:2">2</verse-number>For if someone<note>Literally “a man,” but clearly in a generic sense here meaning “someone, a person”</note> enters into your assembly<note>Literally “synagogue,” but here probably referring to a Christian assembly</note> in fine clothing with a gold ring on his finger, and a poor person in filthy clothing also enters, <verse-number id="Jas 2:3">3</verse-number>and you look favorably on the one wearing the fine clothing and you say, “Be seated here in a good place,” and to the poor person you say, “You stand or be seated there<note>Some manuscripts have “you stand there or be seated”</note> by my footstool,” <verse-number id="Jas 2:4">4</verse-number>have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? <verse-number id="Jas 2:5">5</verse-number>Listen, my dear brothers! Did not God choose the poor of the world <supplied>to be</supplied> rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him? <verse-number id="Jas 2:6">6</verse-number>But you have dishonored the poor! Are not the rich exploiting you and they themselves dragging you into the courts? <verse-number id="Jas 2:7">7</verse-number>Do they themselves not blaspheme the good name <idiom-start/>of the one to whom you belong<idiom-end/><note>Literally “that was called over you”</note>? </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jas 2:8">8</verse-number>However, if you carry out the royal law according to the scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Le 19:18">Lev 19:18</cite></note> you are doing well. <verse-number id="Jas 2:9">9</verse-number>But if you show partiality, you commit sin, <supplied>and thus</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>and thus</supplied>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“are convicted”) which is understood as result</note> are convicted by the law as transgressors. <verse-number id="Jas 2:10">10</verse-number>For whoever keeps the whole law but stumbles in one <supplied>point only</supplied> has become guilty of all <supplied>of it</supplied>. <verse-number id="Jas 2:11">11</verse-number>For the one who said “Do not commit adultery”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Ex 20:14">Exod 20:14</cite>; <cite title="BibleLEB2: Dt 5:18">Deut 5:18</cite></note> also said “Do not murder.”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Ex 20:13">Exod 20:13</cite>; <cite title="BibleLEB2: Dt 5:17">Deut 5:17</cite></note> Now if you do not commit adultery but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. <verse-number id="Jas 2:12">12</verse-number>Thus speak and thus act as those who are going to be judged by the law of liberty. <verse-number id="Jas 2:13">13</verse-number>For judgment <supplied>is</supplied> merciless to the one who has not practiced mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. </p>

			<pericope>Faith and Works</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Jas 2:14">14</verse-number>What <supplied>is</supplied> the benefit, my brothers, if someone says <supplied>that he</supplied> has faith but does not have works? That faith <supplied>is</supplied> not able to save him, <supplied>is it</supplied>?<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here</note> <verse-number id="Jas 2:15">15</verse-number>If a brother or a sister is poorly clothed and lacking food for the day, <verse-number id="Jas 2:16">16</verse-number>and one of you should say to them, “Go in peace, keep warm and <idiom-start/>eat well<idiom-end/><note>Literally, “be satisfied”</note>,” but does not give them what is necessary for the body, what <supplied>is</supplied> the benefit? <verse-number id="Jas 2:17">17</verse-number>Thus also faith, if it does not have works, is dead by itself. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jas 2:18">18</verse-number>But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.”<note>Some see the quotation by “someone” extending to the end of v. <cite title="BibleLEB2:Jas 2:18">18</cite>, while others see it extending through v. <cite title="BibleLEB2:Jas 2:19">19</cite></note> Show me your faith apart from your<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Literally “the”; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun</note> works, and I will show you my<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Literally “the”; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun</note> faith by my works. <verse-number id="Jas 2:19">19</verse-number>You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe, and shudder! <verse-number id="Jas 2:20">20</verse-number>But do you want to know, O foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? <verse-number id="Jas 2:21">21</verse-number>Was not Abraham our father justified by works <supplied>when he</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>when</supplied>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“offered up”) which is understood as temporal</note> offered up his son Isaac on the altar? <verse-number id="Jas 2:22">22</verse-number>You see that faith was working together with his works, and by the works the faith was perfected. <verse-number id="Jas 2:23">23</verse-number>And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness,”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Ge 15:6">Gen 15:6</cite></note> and he was called God’s friend. <verse-number id="Jas 2:24">24</verse-number>You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. <verse-number id="Jas 2:25">25</verse-number>And likewise was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works <supplied>when she</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>when</supplied>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“welcomed”) which is understood as temporal</note> welcomed the messengers and sent <supplied>them</supplied> out by a different route? <verse-number id="Jas 2:26">26</verse-number>For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead. </p>
