			<pericope>Restraining the Tongue</pericope>

If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he <supplied>is</supplied> a perfect individual,<note>Literally “man,” but clearly in a generic sense here meaning “someone, a person”</note> able to hold in check his whole body also. <verse-number id="Jas 3:3">3</verse-number>And if we put bits in the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we also guide their whole bodies. <verse-number id="Jas 3:4">4</verse-number>Behold also ships: <supplied>although they</supplied> are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot wishes. <verse-number id="Jas 3:5">5</verse-number>So also the tongue is a small member <supplied>of the body</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*The words “of the body” are not in the Greek text but are supplied for clarity</note> and boasts great <supplied>things</supplied>. Behold how small a fire sets ablaze how great a forest! <verse-number id="Jas 3:6">6</verse-number>And the tongue <supplied>is</supplied> a fire! The world of unrighteousness,<note>Or “a fire, the world of unrighteousness! The tongue is set among our members”</note> the tongue, is set among our members, defiling the whole body and setting on fire <idiom-start/>the course of human existence<idiom-end/><note>Literally “the wheel of origin”</note>, being set on fire by hell. </p>

My brothers, these <supplied>things</supplied> ought not to be so! <verse-number id="Jas 3:11">11</verse-number>A spring does not pour forth from the same opening fresh and bitter <supplied>water, does it</supplied>?<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here</note> <verse-number id="Jas 3:12">12</verse-number>A fig tree is not able, my brothers, to produce olives, or a grapevine figs. Neither can a saltwater spring produce fresh water. </p>
