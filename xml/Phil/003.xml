			<pericope>Warning Against Evil Workers</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Php 3:1">1</verse-number> Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same <supplied>things</supplied> to you <supplied>is</supplied> not troublesome to me, but <supplied>is</supplied> a safeguard for you. <verse-number id="Php 3:2">2</verse-number>Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the mutilation.<note>This term is a wordplay on the Greek word “circumcision”</note> <verse-number id="Php 3:3">3</verse-number>For we are the circumcision, the ones who worship<note>Or “who serve”</note> by the Spirit<note>Or “in the Spirit”</note> of God and boast in Christ Jesus and do not <supplied>put</supplied> confidence in the flesh, <verse-number id="Php 3:4">4</verse-number>although I <supplied>could</supplied> have confidence even in the flesh. </p>
			<p/>
			<pericope>Righteousness Through Christ</pericope>
			<p>If anyone else thinks to put confidence in the flesh, I <supplied>can do so</supplied> more: <verse-number id="Php 3:5">5</verse-number><idiom-start/>circumcised on the eighth day<idiom-end/><note>Literally “<supplied>with respect to</supplied> circumcision <supplied>it was</supplied> on the eighth day”</note>, from the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew <supplied>born</supplied> from Hebrews, according to the law a Pharisee, <verse-number id="Php 3:6">6</verse-number>according to zeal persecuting the church, according to the righteousness in the law being blameless. <verse-number id="Php 3:7">7</verse-number>But whatever <supplied>things</supplied> were gain to me, these <supplied>things</supplied> I have considered loss because of Christ. <verse-number id="Php 3:8">8</verse-number><idiom-start/>More than that<idiom-end/><note>Literally “but on the contrary”</note>, <supplied>I</supplied> even consider all <supplied>things</supplied> to be loss because of the surpassing greatness of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for the sake of whom I have suffered the loss of all <supplied>things</supplied>, and consider <supplied>them</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> dung, in order that I may gain Christ <verse-number id="Php 3:9">9</verse-number>and may be found in him, not having my righteousness <supplied>which is</supplied> from the law, but <supplied>which is</supplied> through faith in Christ,<note>Or “through Christ’s faithfulness”</note> the righteousness from God on the basis of faith,<note>Or “on the basis of <supplied>his</supplied> faithfulness”</note> <verse-number id="Php 3:10">10</verse-number>so that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death, <verse-number id="Php 3:11">11</verse-number>if somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. <verse-number id="Php 3:12">12</verse-number>Not that I have already received <supplied>this</supplied>,<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> or <supplied>have</supplied> already been made perfect, but I press on if indeed I may lay hold of <supplied>that</supplied> for which also I was laid hold of by Christ.<note>Some manuscripts have “Christ Jesus”</note> <verse-number id="Php 3:13">13</verse-number>Brothers, I do not consider myself to have laid hold of <supplied>it</supplied>.<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> But <supplied>I do</supplied> one <supplied>thing</supplied>, forgetting the things behind and straining toward the things ahead, <verse-number id="Php 3:14">14</verse-number>I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. </p>

			<pericope>Imitate Paul</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Php 3:15">15</verse-number>Therefore as many as <supplied>are</supplied> perfect, <idiom-start/>let us hold this opinion<idiom-end/><note>Literally “let us think this”</note>, and if you think anything differently, God will reveal this also to you. <verse-number id="Php 3:16">16</verse-number>Only to what we have attained, to the same hold on. <verse-number id="Php 3:17">17</verse-number>Become fellow imitators of me, brothers, and observe those who walk in this way, just as you have us <supplied>as</supplied> an example. <verse-number id="Php 3:18">18</verse-number>For many live, of whom I spoke about to you many times, but now speak about even weeping, <supplied>as</supplied> the enemies of the cross of Christ, <verse-number id="Php 3:19">19</verse-number>whose end <supplied>is</supplied> destruction, whose God <supplied>is</supplied> the stomach, and <supplied>whose</supplied> glory <supplied>is</supplied> in their shame, the ones who think on earthly things. <verse-number id="Php 3:20">20</verse-number>For our commonwealth exists in heaven, from which also we eagerly await a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, <verse-number id="Php 3:21">21</verse-number>who will transform our humble body <supplied>to be</supplied> conformed to his glorious body, in accordance with the power that enables him even to subject all <supplied>things</supplied> to himself. </p>
