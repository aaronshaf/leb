So he went and washed and came back seeing. </p>

			<pericope>The Reaction of the Pharisees to the Healing</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 9:13">13</verse-number>They brought him—the one formerly blind—to the Pharisees. <verse-number id="Jn 9:14">14</verse-number>(Now the day on which Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes was the Sabbath.) <verse-number id="Jn 9:15">15</verse-number>So the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received sight. And he said to them, “He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.” <verse-number id="Jn 9:16">16</verse-number>So some of the Pharisees were saying, “This man is not from God, because he does not observe the Sabbath!” Others<note>Some manuscripts have “But others”</note> were saying, “How can a man <supplied>who is</supplied> a sinner perform such signs?” And there was a division among them. <verse-number id="Jn 9:17">17</verse-number>So they said to the blind man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?” And he said, “He is a prophet.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 9:18">18</verse-number>So the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received sight, until they summoned the parents of the one<note>Literally “of him”</note> who received sight. <verse-number id="Jn 9:19">19</verse-number>And they asked them, saying, “Is this man your son, whom you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?” <verse-number id="Jn 9:20">20</verse-number>So his parents answered and said, “We know that this man is our son, and that he was born blind. <verse-number id="Jn 9:21">21</verse-number>But how he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. Ask him! <idiom-start/>He is a mature adult<idiom-end/>;<note>Literally “he has maturity”</note> he will speak for himself!” <verse-number id="Jn 9:22">22</verse-number>(His parents said these <supplied>things</supplied> because they were afraid of the Jews, for the Jews had already decided that if anyone should confess him <supplied>to be</supplied> Christ, he would be expelled from the synagogue. <verse-number id="Jn 9:23">23</verse-number>Because of this his parents said, “<idiom-start/>He is a mature adult<idiom-end/>;<note>Literally “he has maturity”</note> ask him.”) </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 9:24">24</verse-number>So they summoned the man who had been blind for the second time and said to him, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner!” <verse-number id="Jn 9:25">25</verse-number>Then that man replied, “Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One <supplied>thing</supplied> I know—that <supplied>although I</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>although</supplied>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“was”) which is understood as concessive</note> was blind, now I see!” <verse-number id="Jn 9:26">26</verse-number>So they said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” <verse-number id="Jn 9:27">27</verse-number>He replied to them, “I told you already and you did not listen! Why do you want to hear <supplied>it</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> again? You do not want to become his disciples also, <supplied>do you</supplied>?”<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase “<supplied>do you</supplied>”</note> <verse-number id="Jn 9:28">28</verse-number>They reviled<note>Some manuscripts have “And they reviled”</note> him and said, “You are his disciple! But we are disciples of Moses! <verse-number id="Jn 9:29">29</verse-number>We know that God has spoken to Moses, but we do not know where this man is from.” <verse-number id="Jn 9:30">30</verse-number>The man answered and said to them, “For the remarkable thing is this, that you do not know where he is from, and he opened my eyes! <verse-number id="Jn 9:31">31</verse-number>We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if someone is devout and does his will, he listens to this one. <verse-number id="Jn 9:32">32</verse-number>From <idiom-start/>time immemorial<idiom-end/><note>Literally “the age”</note> it has not been heard that someone opened the eyes of one born blind. <verse-number id="Jn 9:33">33</verse-number>If this man were not from God, he would not be able to do anything!” <verse-number id="Jn 9:34">34</verse-number>They answered and said to him, “You were born completely in sin, and are you attempting to teach<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here the present tense is translated as a conative present (“attempting to teach”)</note> us?” And they threw him out. </p>

			<pericope>Jesus as the Son of Man</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 9:35">35</verse-number>Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?” <verse-number id="Jn 9:36">36</verse-number>He answered and said, “And who is <supplied>he</supplied>, sir, that I may believe in him?” <verse-number id="Jn 9:37">37</verse-number>Jesus said to him, “You have both seen him, and he is the one who is speaking with you.” 〚<verse-number id="Jn 9:38">38</verse-number>And he said, “I believe, Lord!” and he worshiped him. <verse-number id="Jn 9:39">39</verse-number>And Jesus said,〛<note>A number of important manuscripts lack v. <cite title="BibleLEB2:Jn 9:38">38</cite> and the first part of v. <cite title="BibleLEB2:Jn 9:39">39</cite> (“and Jesus said”)</note> “For judgment I have come into this world, so that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind!” <verse-number id="Jn 9:40">40</verse-number><supplied>Some</supplied> of the Pharisees who were with him heard these <supplied>things</supplied> and said to him, “We are not also blind, <supplied>are we</supplied>?”<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here, indicated in the translation by the phrase “<supplied>are we</supplied>”</note> <verse-number id="Jn 9:41">41</verse-number>Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would not have sin. But now you say, ‘We see,’ your sin remains. </p>
