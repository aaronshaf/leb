			<pericope>Jesus’ Farewell Discourse</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 14:1">1</verse-number> “Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe<note>Or simply “Believe”; the verb form can be either indicative (e.g., KJV, NAB, NLT) or imperative (e.g., NIV, NRSV, ESV)</note> in God; believe<note>Like the previous verb “believe” this form could also be either indicative or imperative, though most English versions regard it as imperative</note> also in me. <verse-number id="Jn 14:2">2</verse-number>In my Father’s house there are many dwelling places; but if not, I would have told you, because<note>A large number of manuscripts, many of them later, lack “because”</note> I am going away to prepare a place for you. <verse-number id="Jn 14:3">3</verse-number>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself, so that where I am, you may be also. <verse-number id="Jn 14:4">4</verse-number>And you know the way where I am going.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 14:5">5</verse-number>Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How are we able to know the way?” <verse-number id="Jn 14:6">6</verse-number>Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. <verse-number id="Jn 14:7">7</verse-number>If you had known me, you would have known<note>Some manuscripts have “If you have known me, you will know”</note> my Father also. From now on<note>Some manuscripts have “And from now on”</note> you know him and have seen him.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 14:8">8</verse-number>Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.” <verse-number id="Jn 14:9">9</verse-number>Jesus said to him, “Am I with you so long a time and you have not known me, Philip? The one who has seen me has seen the Father! How can you say, ‘Show us the Father?’ <verse-number id="Jn 14:10">10</verse-number>Do you not believe that I <supplied>am</supplied> in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from myself, but the Father residing in me does his works. <verse-number id="Jn 14:11">11</verse-number>Believe me that I <supplied>am</supplied> in the Father and the Father <supplied>is</supplied> in me; but if not, believe because of the works themselves. <verse-number id="Jn 14:12">12</verse-number>Truly, truly I say to you, the one who believes in me, the works that I am doing he will do also, and he will do greater <supplied>works</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> than these because I am going to the Father. <verse-number id="Jn 14:13">13</verse-number>And <idiom-start/>whatever<idiom-end/><note>Literally “anything which”</note> you ask in my name, I will do this, in order that the Father may be glorified in the Son. <verse-number id="Jn 14:14">14</verse-number>If you ask me anything in my name, I will do <supplied>it</supplied>.<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> </p>

			<p><verse-number id="Jn 14:15">15</verse-number>“If you love me, you will keep my commandments. <verse-number id="Jn 14:16">16</verse-number>And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, in order that he may be with you <idiom-start/>forever<idiom-end/><note>Literally “for the age”</note>—<verse-number id="Jn 14:17">17</verse-number>the Spirit of truth, whom the world is not able to receive, because it does not see him or know <supplied>him</supplied>.<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> You know him, because he resides with you and will be in you. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 14:18">18</verse-number>“I will not leave you <supplied>as</supplied> orphans; I am coming to you. <verse-number id="Jn 14:19">19</verse-number>Yet a little <supplied>time</supplied> and the world will see me no longer, but you will see me; because I live, you also will live. <verse-number id="Jn 14:20">20</verse-number>On that day you will know that I <supplied>am</supplied> in my Father, and you <supplied>are</supplied> in me, and I <supplied>am</supplied> in you. <verse-number id="Jn 14:21">21</verse-number>The one who has my commandments and keeps them—that one is the one who loves me. And the one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will reveal myself to him.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 14:22">22</verse-number>Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, why<note>Some manuscripts have “and why”</note> is it that you are going to reveal yourself to us and not to the world?” <verse-number id="Jn 14:23">23</verse-number>Jesus answered and said to him, “If anyone loves me he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and <idiom-start/>will take up residence with him<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “will make abode with him”</note> <verse-number id="Jn 14:24">24</verse-number>The one who does not love me does not keep my words, and the word that you hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me. <verse-number id="Jn 14:25">25</verse-number>These <supplied>things</supplied> I have spoken to you <supplied>while</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>while</supplied>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“residing”) which is understood as temporal</note> residing with you. <verse-number id="Jn 14:26">26</verse-number>But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name—that one will teach you all <supplied>things</supplied>, and will remind you of everything that I said to you. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 14:27">27</verse-number>“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you—not as the world gives, I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not let <supplied>them</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> be afraid. <verse-number id="Jn 14:28">28</verse-number>You have heard that I said to you, ‘I am going away, and I am coming to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I <supplied>am</supplied>. <verse-number id="Jn 14:29">29</verse-number>And now I have told you before <supplied>it</supplied> happens, so that when it happens, you may believe. <verse-number id="Jn 14:30">30</verse-number>I will no longer speak much with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has <idiom-start/>no power<idiom-end/><note>Literally “nothing”</note> <idiom-start/>over<idiom-end/><note>Literally “in”</note> me. <verse-number id="Jn 14:31">31</verse-number>But so that the world may know that I love the Father, and just as the Father has commanded me, thus I am doing. Get up, let us go from here! </p>
