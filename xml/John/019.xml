			<pericope>Pilate Attempts to Release Jesus</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 19:1">1</verse-number> So then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*This verb has causative force in context; Pilate did not personally carry out the sentence</note> <verse-number id="Jn 19:2">2</verse-number>And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and placed <supplied>it</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> on his head, and put a purple robe on him, <verse-number id="Jn 19:3">3</verse-number>and were coming up to him and saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!” and were giving him slaps in the face. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 19:4">4</verse-number>And Pilate came outside again and said to them, “Behold, I am bringing him outside to you, so that you will know that I find no basis for an accusation against him.” <verse-number id="Jn 19:5">5</verse-number>Then Jesus came outside wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, and he said to them, “Behold the man!” <verse-number id="Jn 19:6">6</verse-number>So when they saw him, the chief priests and the officers shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify!” Pilate said to them, “You take him and crucify <supplied>him</supplied>!<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> For I do not find a basis for an accusation against him.” <verse-number id="Jn 19:7">7</verse-number>The Jews replied to him, “We have a law, and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself out to be the Son of God!” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 19:8">8</verse-number>So when Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid, <verse-number id="Jn 19:9">9</verse-number>and he entered into the governor’s residence again and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus did not give him an answer. <verse-number id="Jn 19:10">10</verse-number>So Pilate said to him, “Will you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and I have authority to crucify you?” <verse-number id="Jn 19:11">11</verse-number>Jesus replied to him, “You would not have any authority over me unless it was given to you from above. For this <supplied>reason</supplied> the one who handed me over to you has greater sin.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 19:12">12</verse-number>From this <supplied>point on</supplied> Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews shouted, saying, “If you release this man, you are not a friend of Caesar! Everyone who makes himself out to be a king opposes Caesar!” <verse-number id="Jn 19:13">13</verse-number>So Pilate, <supplied>when he</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>when</supplied>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“heard”) which is understood as temporal</note> heard these words, brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat, in the place called The Stone Pavement (but <i>Gabbatha</i> in Aramaic). <verse-number id="Jn 19:14">14</verse-number>(Now it was the day of preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews, “Behold your king!” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 19:15">15</verse-number>Then those shouted, “Away <supplied>with him</supplied>! Away <supplied>with him</supplied>! Crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your king?” The chief priests replied, “We do not have a king except Caesar!” <verse-number id="Jn 19:16">16</verse-number>So then he handed him over to them in order that he could be crucified. </p>
			<p/>
			<pericope>Jesus Is Crucified</pericope>
			<p>So they took Jesus, <verse-number id="Jn 19:17">17</verse-number>and carrying for himself the cross, he went out to the <supplied>place</supplied> called The Place of a Skull (which is called <i>Golgotha</i> in Aramaic), <verse-number id="Jn 19:18">18</verse-number>where they crucified him, and with him two others, <idiom-start/>one on each side<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “from here and from here”</note> and Jesus in the middle. <verse-number id="Jn 19:19">19</verse-number>And Pilate also wrote a notice and placed <supplied>it</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> on the cross, and it was written: “Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews.” <verse-number id="Jn 19:20">20</verse-number>So many of the Jews read this notice, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, <supplied>and</supplied> in Greek. <verse-number id="Jn 19:21">21</verse-number>Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The king of the Jews,’ but, ‘He said, I am king of the Jews.’ ” <verse-number id="Jn 19:22">22</verse-number>Pilate replied, “What I have written, I have written.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 19:23">23</verse-number>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothing and made four shares—for each soldier a share—and the tunic. (Now the tunic was seamless, woven from the top <idiom-start/>in a single piece<idiom-end/>.)<note>Literally “through the whole”</note> <verse-number id="Jn 19:24">24</verse-number>So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it apart, but cast lots for it, <supplied>to see</supplied> whose it will be,” so that the scripture would be fulfilled that says, </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>“They divided my garments among themselves, </li1>
				<li2>and for my clothing they cast lots.”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Ps 22:18">Ps 22:18</cite></note> </li2>
			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p>Thus the soldiers did these <supplied>things</supplied>. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 19:25">25</verse-number>Now his mother and the sister of his mother, Mary the <supplied>wife</supplied> of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene were standing near the cross of Jesus. <verse-number id="Jn 19:26">26</verse-number>So Jesus, seeing <supplied>his</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Literally “the”; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun</note> mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, said to <supplied>his</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Literally “the”; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun</note> mother, “Woman, behold your son!” <verse-number id="Jn 19:27">27</verse-number>Then he said to the disciple, “Behold your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own <supplied>home</supplied>. </p>
			<p/>
			<pericope>Jesus Dies on the Cross</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 19:28">28</verse-number>After this, Jesus, knowing that now at last everything was completed, in order that the scripture would be fulfilled, said, “I am thirsty.” <verse-number id="Jn 19:29">29</verse-number>A jar full of sour wine was standing there, so <supplied>they</supplied> put a sponge full of the sour wine on a <supplied>branch of</supplied> hyssop <supplied>and</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>and</supplied>” is supplied because the previous participle (“put”) has been translated as a finite verb</note> brought <supplied>it</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> to his mouth. <verse-number id="Jn 19:30">30</verse-number>Then when he had received the sour wine, Jesus said, “It is completed,”<note>Or (traditionally) “it is finished”</note> and bowing <supplied>his</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Literally “the”; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun</note> head, he gave up <supplied>his</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Literally “the”; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun</note> spirit. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 19:31">31</verse-number>Then the Jews, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was an important day), asked Pilate that their legs could be broken and they could be taken away. <verse-number id="Jn 19:32">32</verse-number>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him. <verse-number id="Jn 19:33">33</verse-number>But <supplied>when they</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>when</supplied>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“came”) which is understood as temporal</note> came to Jesus, after they saw he was already dead, they did not break his legs. <verse-number id="Jn 19:34">34</verse-number>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water came out immediately. <verse-number id="Jn 19:35">35</verse-number>And the one who has seen <supplied>it</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> has testified, and his testimony is true, and that person knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe. <verse-number id="Jn 19:36">36</verse-number>For these <supplied>things</supplied> happened in order that the scripture would be fulfilled: “Not a bone of his will be broken.”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Ex 12:46">Exod 12:46</cite>, <cite title="BibleLEB2: Nu 9:12">Num 9:12</cite>, and <cite title="BibleLEB2: Ps 34:20">Ps 34:20</cite></note> <verse-number id="Jn 19:37">37</verse-number>And again another scripture says, “They will look on <supplied>the one</supplied> whom they have pierced.”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Zec 12:10">Zech 12:10</cite></note> </p>
			<p/>
			<pericope>Jesus Is Buried</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 19:38">38</verse-number>And after these <supplied>things</supplied>, Joseph <supplied>who was</supplied> from Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus (but a secret one for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate allowed <supplied>it</supplied>,<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> so he came and took away his body. <verse-number id="Jn 19:39">39</verse-number>And Nicodemus—the one who had come to him formerly at night—also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes <supplied>weighing</supplied> about a hundred pounds.<note>The Greek term refers to a Roman pound, 327.45 grams (approximately 12 ounces)</note> <verse-number id="Jn 19:40">40</verse-number>So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in <supplied>strips of</supplied> linen cloth with the fragrant spices, as is the Jews’ custom to prepare for burial. <verse-number id="Jn 19:41">41</verse-number>Now <supplied>there</supplied> was a garden at the place where he was crucified, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one was yet buried. <verse-number id="Jn 19:42">42</verse-number>So there, on account of the day of preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was close by, they buried Jesus. </p>
