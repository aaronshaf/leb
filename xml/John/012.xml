			<pericope>Jesus Is Anointed at Bethany</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 12:1">1</verse-number> Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. <verse-number id="Jn 12:2">2</verse-number>So they made him a dinner there, and Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of the ones reclining at table with him. <verse-number id="Jn 12:3">3</verse-number>Then Mary took a pound<note>The Greek term refers to a Roman pound, 327.45 grams (approximately 12 ounces)</note> of ointment of very valuable genuine nard <supplied>and</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>and</supplied>” is supplied because the previous participle (“took”) has been translated as a finite verb</note> anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment. <verse-number id="Jn 12:4">4</verse-number>But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was going to betray him) said, <verse-number id="Jn 12:5">5</verse-number>“<idiom-start/>Why<idiom-end/><note>Literally “because of what”</note> was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?” <verse-number id="Jn 12:6">6</verse-number>(Now he said this not because <idiom-start/>he was concerned<idiom-end/><note>Literally “it was a concern to him”</note> about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, he used to steal what was put into <supplied>it</supplied>.)<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> <verse-number id="Jn 12:7">7</verse-number>So Jesus said, “Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my preparation for burial. <verse-number id="Jn 12:8">8</verse-number>For you have the poor with you always, but you do not always have me.” </p>
			<p/>
			<pericope>The Decision to Kill Lazarus</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 12:9">9</verse-number>Now a large crowd<note>Some manuscripts have “the large crowd”</note> of Jews found out that he was there, and they came, not only because of Jesus, but so that they could see Lazarus also, whom he raised from the dead. <verse-number id="Jn 12:10">10</verse-number>So the chief priests decided that they would kill Lazarus also, <verse-number id="Jn 12:11">11</verse-number>because on account of him many of the Jews were going and believing in Jesus. </p>
			<p/>
			<pericope>The Triumphal Entry</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 12:12">12</verse-number>On the next day the large crowd who had come to the feast, <supplied>when they</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>when</supplied>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“heard”) which is understood as temporal</note> heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, <verse-number id="Jn 12:13">13</verse-number>took the branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, and began crying out, </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>“Hosanna! </li1>
				<li1>Blessed <supplied>is</supplied> the one who comes in the name of the Lord,<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Ps 118:25–26">Ps 118:25–26</cite></note> </li1>
				<li1>even the king of Israel!” </li1>
			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 12:14">14</verse-number>So Jesus found a young donkey <supplied>and</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>and</supplied>” is supplied because the previous participle (“found”) has been translated as a finite verb</note> sat on it, just as it is written, </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1><verse-number id="Jn 12:15">15</verse-number>“Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion! </li1>
				<li1>Behold, your king is coming, </li1>
				<li1>seated on the foal of a donkey!”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Zec 9:9">Zech 9:9</cite></note> </li1>
			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 12:16">16</verse-number>(His disciples did not understand these <supplied>things</supplied> at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these <supplied>things</supplied> had been written about him and they did these <supplied>things</supplied> to him.) <verse-number id="Jn 12:17">17</verse-number>So the crowd who was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were continuing to testify. <verse-number id="Jn 12:18">18</verse-number>Because of this also the crowd went to meet him, for they had heard <supplied>that</supplied> he had performed this sign. <verse-number id="Jn 12:19">19</verse-number>So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are accomplishing nothing! Behold, the world has gone after him.” </p>
			<p/>
			<pericope>Greeks Seeking Jesus</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 12:20">20</verse-number>Now some Greeks were among those who had gone up in order to worship at the feast. <verse-number id="Jn 12:21">21</verse-number>So these approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and began asking him saying, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.” <verse-number id="Jn 12:22">22</verse-number>Philip went and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. <verse-number id="Jn 12:23">23</verse-number>And Jesus answered them, saying, “The hour has come that the Son of Man will be glorified. <verse-number id="Jn 12:24">24</verse-number>Truly, truly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth <supplied>and</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>and</supplied>” is supplied because the previous participle (“falls”) has been translated as a finite verb</note> dies, it remains <supplied>by</supplied> itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit. <verse-number id="Jn 12:25">25</verse-number>The one who loves his life loses it, and the one who hates his life in this world preserves it for eternal life. <verse-number id="Jn 12:26">26</verse-number>If anyone serves me, he must follow me, and where I am, there my servant will be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him. </p>
			<p/>
			<pericope>Jesus Predicts His Death</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 12:27">27</verse-number>“Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, deliver me from this hour’? But for this <supplied>reason</supplied> I have come to this hour! <verse-number id="Jn 12:28">28</verse-number>Father, glorify your name!” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have both glorified <supplied>it</supplied>,<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> and I will glorify <supplied>it</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> again.” <verse-number id="Jn 12:29">29</verse-number>Now the crowd that stood <supplied>there</supplied> and heard <supplied>it</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> said <idiom-start/>it had thundered<idiom-end/>.<note>Literally “thunder had happened”</note> Others were saying, “An angel has spoken to him!” <verse-number id="Jn 12:30">30</verse-number>Jesus answered and said, “This voice has not happened for my sake, but <supplied>for</supplied> your sake. <verse-number id="Jn 12:31">31</verse-number>Now is the judgment of this world! Now the ruler of this world will be thrown out! <verse-number id="Jn 12:32">32</verse-number>And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all <supplied>people</supplied> to myself.” <verse-number id="Jn 12:33">33</verse-number>(Now he said this to indicate by what sort of death he was going to die.) </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 12:34">34</verse-number>Then the crowd replied to him, “We have heard from the law that the Christ remains <idiom-start/>forever<idiom-end/>!<note>Literally “for the age”; probably an allusion to <cite title="BibleLEB2: Ps 89:35–37">Ps 89:35–37 </cite>(in common usage “law” could refer to the entire Old Testament)</note> And how do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” <verse-number id="Jn 12:35">35</verse-number>So Jesus said to them, “Yet a little time the light is with you! Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness does not overtake you! And the one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. <verse-number id="Jn 12:36">36</verse-number>While you have the light, believe in the light, in order that you may become sons of light.” Jesus said these <supplied>things</supplied>, and <supplied>then</supplied> he went away <supplied>and</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>and</supplied>” is supplied because the previous participle (“went away”) has been translated as a finite verb</note> was hidden from them. </p>
			<p/>
			<pericope>The People Still Refuse to Believe</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 12:37">37</verse-number>But as many signs <supplied>as</supplied> he had performed before them, they did not believe in him, <verse-number id="Jn 12:38">38</verse-number>in order that the word of the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said, </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>“Lord, who has believed our message? </li1>
				<li2>And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Is 53:1">Isa 53:1</cite></note> </li2>
			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 12:39">39</verse-number>For this <supplied>reason</supplied> they were not able to believe, because again Isaiah said, </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1><verse-number id="Jn 12:40">40</verse-number>“He has blinded their eyes </li1>
				<li2>and hardened their hearts, </li2>
				<li1>lest they see with <supplied>their</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Literally “the”; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun</note> eyes </li1>
				<li2>and understand with <supplied>their</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Literally “the”; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun</note> hearts </li2>
				<li1>and turn, and I heal them.”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Is 6:10">Isa 6:10</cite></note> </li1>
			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 12:41">41</verse-number>Isaiah said these <supplied>things</supplied> because he saw his glory, and he spoke about him. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 12:42">42</verse-number>Yet despite that, even many of the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <supplied>it</supplied>,<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> so that they would not be expelled from the synagogue. <verse-number id="Jn 12:43">43</verse-number>For they loved the praise of men more than praise from God. </p>
			<p/>
			<pericope>Jesus’ Final Public Appeal</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Jn 12:44">44</verse-number>But Jesus cried out and said, “The one who believes in me does not believe in me, but in the one who sent me, <verse-number id="Jn 12:45">45</verse-number>and the one who sees me sees the one who sent me. <verse-number id="Jn 12:46">46</verse-number>I have come <supplied>as</supplied> a light into the world, in order that everyone who believes in me will not remain in the darkness. <verse-number id="Jn 12:47">47</verse-number>And if anyone hears my words and does not observe <supplied>them</supplied>,<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> I will not judge him. For I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world. <verse-number id="Jn 12:48">48</verse-number>The one who rejects me and does not accept my words has one who judges him; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day. <verse-number id="Jn 12:49">49</verse-number>For I have not spoken from myself, but the Father himself who sent me <idiom-start/>has commanded me<idiom-end/><note>Literally “has given me commandment”</note> what I should say and what I should speak. <verse-number id="Jn 12:50">50</verse-number>And I know that his commandment is eternal life. So <supplied>the things</supplied> that I say, just as the Father said to me, thus I say.” </p>
