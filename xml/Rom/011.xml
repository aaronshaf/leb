			<pericope>A Remnant of Israel Remains</pericope>

For I also am an Israelite, from the descendants of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. <verse-number id="Ro 11:2">2</verse-number>God has not rejected his people, whom he foreknew! Or do you not know, in <supplied>the passage about</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*The words “the passage about” are not in the Greek text, but are supplied for clarity</note> Elijah, what the scripture says—how he appeals to God against Israel? <verse-number id="Ro 11:3">3</verse-number>“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life!”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: 1 Ki 19:10">1 Kgs 19:10</cite>, <cite title="BibleLEB2: 1 Ki 19:14">14</cite></note> <verse-number id="Ro 11:4">4</verse-number>But what does the divine response say to him? “I have left for myself seven thousand people<note>Or perhaps “males,” referring to men only</note> who have not bent the knee to Baal.”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: 1 Ki 19:18">1 Kgs 19:18</cite></note> <verse-number id="Ro 11:5">5</verse-number>So in this way also at the present time, there is a remnant <idiom-start/>selected by grace<idiom-end/><note>Literally “according to selection of grace”</note>. <verse-number id="Ro 11:6">6</verse-number>But if by grace, <supplied>it is</supplied> no longer by works, for otherwise grace would no longer be grace. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Ro 11:7">7</verse-number>What then? What Israel was searching for, this it did not obtain. But the elect obtained <supplied>it</supplied>, and the rest were hardened, <verse-number id="Ro 11:8">8</verse-number>just as it is written, </p>

			<ul>
				<li1>“Let their table become a snare and a trap, </li1>
				<li2>and a cause for stumbling and a retribution to them; </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Ro 11:10">10</verse-number>let their eyes be darkened so that they do not see, </li1>

			<p><verse-number id="Ro 11:11">11</verse-number>I say then, they did not stumble so that they fell, <supplied>did they</supplied>?<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here</note> May it never be! But by their trespass, salvation <supplied>has come</supplied> to the Gentiles, in order to provoke them <supplied>to jealousy</supplied>.<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*The words “to jealousy” are not in the Greek text, but are supplied for clarity</note> <verse-number id="Ro 11:12">12</verse-number>And if their trespass <supplied>means</supplied> riches for the world and their loss <supplied>means</supplied> riches for the Gentiles, how much more <supplied>will</supplied> their fullness <supplied>mean</supplied>? </p>

			<pericope>Gentile Branches Grafted in</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Ro 11:13">13</verse-number>Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Therefore, inasmuch as I am apostle to the Gentiles, I promote my ministry, <verse-number id="Ro 11:14">14</verse-number>if somehow I may provoke my people to jealousy and save some of them. <verse-number id="Ro 11:15">15</verse-number>For if their rejection <supplied>means</supplied> the reconciliation of the world, what <supplied>will</supplied> their acceptance <supplied>mean</supplied> except life from the dead? <verse-number id="Ro 11:16">16</verse-number>Now if the first fruits <supplied>are</supplied> holy, <supplied>so</supplied> also <supplied>is</supplied> the <supplied>whole</supplied> batch of dough, and if the root <supplied>is</supplied> holy, <supplied>so</supplied> also <supplied>are</supplied> the branches. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Ro 11:17">17</verse-number>Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, <supplied>although you</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>although</supplied>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“were”) which is understood as concessive</note> were a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them and became a sharer of the root of the olive tree’s richness, <verse-number id="Ro 11:18">18</verse-number>do not boast against the branches. But if you boast against <supplied>them</supplied>, you do not support the root, but the root <supplied>supports</supplied> you. <verse-number id="Ro 11:19">19</verse-number>Then you will say, “Branches were broken off in order that I could be grafted in.” <verse-number id="Ro 11:20">20</verse-number>Well said! They were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand firm because of faith. Do not think arrogant <supplied>thoughts</supplied>, but be afraid. <verse-number id="Ro 11:21">21</verse-number>For if God did not spare the <idiom-start/>natural<idiom-end/><note>Literally “according to nature”</note> branches, neither will he spare you.<note>Some manuscripts have “perhaps he will not spare you either”</note> <verse-number id="Ro 11:22">22</verse-number>See, then, the kindness and severity of God: severity upon those who have fallen, but upon you the kindness of God—if you continue in his kindness, for otherwise you also will be cut off. <verse-number id="Ro 11:23">23</verse-number>And those also, if they do not persist in unbelief, will be grafted in, because God is able to graft them in again. <verse-number id="Ro 11:24">24</verse-number>For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are <idiom-start/>natural branches<idiom-end/><note>Literally “by nature”</note> be grafted into their own olive tree? </p>

			<pericope>All Israel to be Saved</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Ro 11:25">25</verse-number>For I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of this mystery, so that you will not be wise <idiom-start/>in your own sight<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “in yourselves”</note> that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in, <verse-number id="Ro 11:26">26</verse-number>and so all Israel will be saved, just as it is written, </p>
