			<p><verse-number id="Ac 10:30">30</verse-number>And Cornelius said, “<idiom-start/>Four days ago at this hour<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “from the fourth day until this hour”</note> <supplied>the</supplied> ninth, I was praying in my house. And behold, a man in shining clothing stood before me <verse-number id="Ac 10:31">31</verse-number>and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your charitable deeds have been remembered before God. <verse-number id="Ac 10:32">32</verse-number>Therefore send to Joppa and summon Simon who is also called Peter.

Then Peter said, <verse-number id="Ac 10:47">47</verse-number>“Surely no one can withhold the water for these <supplied>people</supplied> to be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as we also did!” <verse-number id="Ac 10:48">48</verse-number>So he ordered <supplied>that</supplied> they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for several days. </p>
