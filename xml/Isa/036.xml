			<p><verse-number id="Is 36:1">1</verse-number>And this happened: In <idiom-start/>the fourteenth year<idiom-end/><note>Literally “four ten year”</note> of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria went up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and he captured them. <verse-number id="Is 36:2">2</verse-number>And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh<note>Rabshekah is the title of a high Assyrian official</note> from Lachish to Jerusalem, to King Hezekiah, with a large army, and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on <supplied>the</supplied> highway of <supplied>the</supplied> field of <supplied>the</supplied> washer. <verse-number id="Is 36:3">3</verse-number>And Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who <idiom-start/>was in charge of the palace<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “<supplied>was</supplied> over the house”</note> came out to him, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the reminder. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Is 36:4">4</verse-number>And Rabshakeh said to them, “Now say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: “What <supplied>is</supplied> this confidence <supplied>in</supplied> which you trust? <verse-number id="Is 36:5">5</verse-number>I said, ‘Only a word of lips! <idiom-start/>War has power and a plan<idiom-end/>!’<note>The Hebrew here is awkward; literally “Plan and power for war”</note> Now, in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me? <verse-number id="Is 36:6">6</verse-number>Look, you trust in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt, which <supplied>if</supplied> a man leans on it, goes into his hand and bores through it! Such <supplied>is</supplied> Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to all those who trust in him. <verse-number id="Is 36:7">7</verse-number>And if you say to me, ‘We trust in Yahweh our God,’ <supplied>was it</supplied> not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed? And he said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall bow down in the <idiom-start/>presence<idiom-end/><note>Literally “face”</note> of this altar.’ ” <verse-number id="Is 36:8">8</verse-number>And now please make a wager with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, <supplied>that is,</supplied> if you are able <idiom-start/>put<idiom-end/><note>Literally “give”</note> riders for yourself on them! <verse-number id="Is 36:9">9</verse-number>But how can you drive back <idiom-start/>one governor among the least of my master’s servants<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “the face of the governor of the one of the insignificant servants of my master”</note> when<note>Or “and”</note> you trust in Egypt for chariots<note>Hebrew “chariot”</note> and horsemen? <verse-number id="Is 36:10">10</verse-number>And now was it without Yahweh that I have come up against this land to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, “Go up against this land and destroy it!” ’ ” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Is 36:11">11</verse-number>And Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we can understand<note>Or “hear”</note> <supplied>it</supplied>, and you must not speak to us in Judean in the <idiom-start/>hearing<idiom-end/><note>Literally “ear”</note> of the people who <supplied>are</supplied> on the wall.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Is 36:12">12</verse-number>But<note>Or “And”</note> Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me to speak these words to your masters and you? <supplied>Was it</supplied> not for the people who sit on the wall, to eat their dung and drink their urine<note>So Masoretic Hebrew text (<i>Kethib</i>); the reading tradition (<i>Qere</i>) has “feet-water”</note> with you?” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Is 36:13">13</verse-number>Then<note>Or “And”</note> Rabshakeh stood and called in a great voice in Judean and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. <verse-number id="Is 36:14">14</verse-number>Thus says the king: ‘<supplied>Do</supplied> not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you! <verse-number id="Is 36:15">15</verse-number>And <supplied>do</supplied> not let Hezekiah make you rely on Yahweh, saying, “Surely Yahweh will deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria!” <verse-number id="Is 36:16">16</verse-number>You must not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria: “Make a blessing<note>That is, a gesture of surrender</note> with me, and come out to me, and each one will eat <supplied>from</supplied> his vine and <supplied>from</supplied> his fig tree and drink water from<note>Or “of”</note> his cistern, <verse-number id="Is 36:17">17</verse-number>until <idiom-start/>I come<idiom-end/><note>Literally “my coming”</note> and take you to a land like your land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, <verse-number id="Is 36:18">18</verse-number>lest Hezekiah mislead you, saying, ‘Yahweh will save us!’ Did the gods of the nations each save his land from the hand of the king of Assyria? <verse-number id="Is 36:19">19</verse-number>Where <supplied>are</supplied> the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where <supplied>are</supplied> the gods of Sepharvaim? Indeed, <supplied>have</supplied> they delivered Samaria from my hand? <verse-number id="Is 36:20">20</verse-number>Who <supplied>are there</supplied> among all the gods of these countries who have saved their land from my hand, that Yahweh should save Jerusalem from my hand?” ’ ” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Is 36:21">21</verse-number>But<note>Or “And”</note> they were silent and did not answer him a word, for the command of the king was, “You must not answer him.” <verse-number id="Is 36:22">22</verse-number>Then<note>Or “And”</note> Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who <supplied>was</supplied> over the <idiom-start/>palace<idiom-end/>,<note>Literally “house”</note> Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the reminder, came to Hezekiah <supplied>with</supplied> torn garments and told him the words of Rabshakeh. </p>
