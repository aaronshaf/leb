				<li1>He had no form and no majesty that<note>Or “and”</note> we should see him, </li1>
				<li2>and no appearance that<note>Or “and”</note> we should take pleasure in him. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Is 53:3">3</verse-number><supplied>He was</supplied> despised and rejected <supplied>by</supplied> men, </li1>
				<li2>a man of suffering, and acquainted with<note>Or “knowledgeable of”</note> sickness, </li2>
