			<pericope>The Egyptians are No Help</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Is 31:1">1</verse-number>Ah! Those who go down <supplied>to</supplied> Egypt for help! </p>
			<p>They rely on horses </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>and trust in chariots because <supplied>they are</supplied> many, </li1>
				<li2>and in horsemen because they are very numerous, </li2>
				<li1>and they do not look to the holy one of Israel, </li1>
				<li2>and they do not consult Yahweh. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Is 31:2">2</verse-number>And indeed, he <supplied>is</supplied> wise, and he brings disaster, </li1>
				<li2>and he does not remove his words, </li2>
				<li1>and he will rise against <supplied>the</supplied> house of evildoers </li1>
				<li2>and against <supplied>the</supplied> help of workers of iniquity. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Is 31:3">3</verse-number>And the Egyptians <supplied>are</supplied> human and not God, </li1>
				<li2>and their horses <supplied>are</supplied> flesh and not spirit. </li2>
				<li1>And Yahweh stretches out his hand, </li1>
				<li2>and <supplied>the</supplied> helper will stumble, </li2>
				<li1>and <supplied>the</supplied> one being helped will fall, </li1>
				<li2>and together all of them will come to an end.<note>Or “perish”</note> </li2>
			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p><verse-number id="Is 31:4">4</verse-number>For Yahweh said this to me: </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>“As which <supplied>a</supplied> lion growls </li1>
				<li2>and <supplied>a</supplied> young lion over its prey </li2>
			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p>when <idiom-start/>a full group<idiom-end/><note>Literally “fullness”</note> of shepherds is called against him, </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>it is not terrified by their voice, </li1>
				<li2>and to their noise it does not respond, </li2>
				<li1>so Yahweh of hosts will come down to fight upon Mount Zion </li1>
				<li2>and upon its hill. </li2>
			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p><verse-number id="Is 31:5">5</verse-number>Like birds flying <supplied>overhead</supplied>, so Yahweh of hosts will protect Jerusalem; </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>he will protect and deliver <supplied>it</supplied>; </li1>
				<li2>he will pass over and rescue <supplied>it</supplied>. </li2>
			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p><verse-number id="Is 31:6">6</verse-number>Turn back to <supplied>the one against</supplied> whom the sons of Israel have made deep rebellion. </p>

				<li1><verse-number id="Is 31:7">7</verse-number>For on that day, each one will reject his idols of silver </li1>
				<li2>and his idols of gold which your hands have made <supplied>in</supplied> sin for you. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Is 31:8">8</verse-number>And Assyria shall fall by a sword not <supplied>of</supplied> a man, </li1>
