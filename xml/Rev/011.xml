			<pericope>The Two Witnesses</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Re 11:1">1</verse-number> And a measuring rod similar in appearance to a staff was given to me, saying, “Get up and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship in it. <verse-number id="Re 11:2">2</verse-number>And leave out the courtyard outside of the temple, and do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles, and they will trample the holy city <supplied>for</supplied> forty two months. <verse-number id="Re 11:3">3</verse-number>And I will grant <supplied>authority</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy <supplied>for one</supplied> thousand two hundred sixty days, dressed in sackcloth.” <verse-number id="Re 11:4">4</verse-number>These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. <verse-number id="Re 11:5">5</verse-number>And if anyone wants to harm them, fire comes out of their mouth and consumes their enemies. And if anyone wants to harm them, in this way he must be killed. <verse-number id="Re 11:6">6</verse-number>These have the authority to shut the sky, so that <idiom-start/>it does not rain<idiom-end/><note>Literally “it does not rain rain”; the redundancy is removed in the translation</note> during the days of their prophecy. And they have authority over the waters, to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with every plague as often as they wish. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Re 11:7">7</verse-number>And when they have completed their testimony, the beast that comes up from the abyss will make war with them and will conquer them and will kill them. <verse-number id="Re 11:8">8</verse-number>And their dead bodies <supplied>will lie</supplied> in the street of the great city which is called symbolically Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. <verse-number id="Re 11:9">9</verse-number>And <supplied>those</supplied> from peoples and tribes and languages and nations will see their dead bodies three and a half days, and they will not allow their dead bodies to be placed in a tomb. <verse-number id="Re 11:10">10</verse-number>And those who live on the earth will rejoice over them, and will celebrate and will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who live on the earth. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Re 11:11">11</verse-number>And after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. <verse-number id="Re 11:12">12</verse-number>And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here,” and they went up into heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them. <verse-number id="Re 11:13">13</verse-number>And at that hour a great earthquake took place, and a tenth of the city collapsed, and seven thousand <idiom-start/>people<idiom-end/><note>Literally “names of men”</note> were killed by the earthquake, and the rest became terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. <verse-number id="Re 11:14">14</verse-number>The second woe has passed. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly! </p>
			<p/>
			<pericope>The Blowing of the Seventh Trumpet</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Re 11:15">15</verse-number>And the seventh angel blew the trumpet, and there was a loud voice in heaven saying, </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>“The kingdom of the world has become <supplied>the kingdom</supplied> of our Lord </li1>
				<li2>and of his Christ, </li2>
				<li1>and he will reign <idiom-start/>forever and ever<idiom-end/><note>Literally “for the ages of the ages”</note>.” </li1>
			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p><verse-number id="Re 11:16">16</verse-number>And the twenty-four elders <supplied>who are</supplied> seated on their thrones before God fell down on their faces and worshiped God, <verse-number id="Re 11:17">17</verse-number>saying, </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>“We give thanks to you, Lord God All-Powerful, </li1>
				<li2>the one who is and the one who was, </li2>
				<li1>because you have taken your great power </li1>
				<li2>and have begun to reign. </li2>
				<li1><verse-number id="Re 11:18">18</verse-number>And the nations were angry, </li1>
				<li2>and your wrath has come, </li2>
				<li2>and the time for the dead to be judged, </li2>
				<li1>and to give their<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Literally “the”; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun</note> reward to your slaves the prophets </li1>
				<li2>and to the saints and to the ones who fear your name, </li2>
				<li2>the small and the great, </li2>
				<li1>and to destroy those who destroy the earth.” </li1>
			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p><verse-number id="Re 11:19">19</verse-number>And the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant appeared in his temple, and there were lightnings and sounds and thunders and an earthquake and large hail.<note>Or “a great hailstorm”</note> </p>
