			<pericope>The Lamb and the 144,000 on Mount Zion</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Re 14:1">1</verse-number> And I looked, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him one hundred forty-four thousand who had his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads. <verse-number id="Re 14:2">2</verse-number>And I heard a sound from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder, and the sound that I heard <supplied>was</supplied> like harpists playing on their harps. <verse-number id="Re 14:3">3</verse-number>And they were singing <supplied>something</supplied> like a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders, and no one was able to learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand who had been bought from the earth. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Re 14:4">4</verse-number>These are those who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins. These <supplied>are</supplied> the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were bought from humanity <supplied>as</supplied> first fruits to God and to the Lamb, <verse-number id="Re 14:5">5</verse-number>and in their mouth a lie was not found; they are blameless. </p>

			<pericope>The Three Angels and Their Messages</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Re 14:6">6</verse-number>And I saw another angel flying <idiom-start/>directly overhead<idiom-end/><note>Literally, “in midheaven”</note>, having an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who reside on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and language and people, <verse-number id="Re 14:7">7</verse-number>saying with a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come, and worship the one who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and the springs of water!” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Re 14:8">8</verse-number>And another second angel followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen <supplied>is</supplied> Babylon the great, who caused all the nations to drink from the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Re 14:9">9</verse-number>And another third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, <verse-number id="Re 14:10">10</verse-number>he himself also will drink of the wine of the anger of God that has been mixed full strength in the cup of his wrath, and will be tortured with fire and sulphur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. <verse-number id="Re 14:11">11</verse-number>And the smoke of their torture went up <idiom-start/>forever and ever<idiom-end/><note>Literally “for the ages of the ages”</note>, and those who worshiped the beast and his image did not have rest day and night, <idiom-start/>along with anyone who received<idiom-end/><note>Literally “and if anyone received”</note> the mark of his name. <verse-number id="Re 14:12">12</verse-number>Here is the patient endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith in Jesus. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Re 14:13">13</verse-number>And I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write: </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>‘Blessed <supplied>are</supplied> the dead who die in the Lord from now on!’ ” </li1>
			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p>“Yes,” says the Spirit, “in order that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow after them.” </p>

			<pericope>The Earth is Harvested</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Re 14:14">14</verse-number>And I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud was seated <supplied>one</supplied> like a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. <verse-number id="Re 14:15">15</verse-number>And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a loud voice to the one seated on the cloud, “Send out your sickle and reap, because the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe!” <verse-number id="Re 14:16">16</verse-number>And the one seated on the cloud swung his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Re 14:17">17</verse-number>And another angel came out of the temple <supplied>that is</supplied> in heaven; he also had a sharp sickle. <verse-number id="Re 14:18">18</verse-number>And another angel who had authority over the fire <supplied>went out</supplied> from the altar, and he called out with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying, “Send out your sharp sickle and harvest the clusters of grapes from the vine of the earth, because its grapes are at their prime!” <verse-number id="Re 14:19">19</verse-number>And the angel swung his sickle into the earth and harvested the vine of the earth, and threw <supplied>the grapes</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> into the great winepress of the wrath of God. <verse-number id="Re 14:20">20</verse-number>And the winepress was stomped outside the city, and blood went out from the winepress up to the bridles of the horses, about one thousand six hundred stadia.<note>That is, about 300 km (200 mi); a <i>stade</i> (plural <i>stadia</i>) was a measure of distance about 192 m (607 ft)</note> </p>
