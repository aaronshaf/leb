			<pericope>John’s Vision of the Son of Man</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Re 1:9">9</verse-number>I, John, your brother and co-sharer in the affliction and kingdom and steadfastness in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus. <verse-number id="Re 1:10">10</verse-number>I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a great sound like a trumpet <verse-number id="Re 1:11">11</verse-number>saying, “What you see, write in a book and send <supplied>it</supplied> to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.” </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Re 1:12">12</verse-number>And I turned to see the voice which was speaking with me, and <supplied>when I</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>when</supplied>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“turned”) which is understood as temporal</note> turned, I saw seven gold lampstands, <verse-number id="Re 1:13">13</verse-number>and in the midst of the lampstands <supplied>one</supplied> like a son of man, dressed in <supplied>a robe</supplied> reaching to the feet and girded around his<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Literally “the”; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun</note> chest <supplied>with</supplied> a golden belt, <verse-number id="Re 1:14">14</verse-number>and his head and hair <supplied>were</supplied> white like wool, white as snow, and his eyes <supplied>were</supplied> like a fiery flame, <verse-number id="Re 1:15">15</verse-number>and his feet <supplied>were</supplied> like fine bronze when it has been fired in a furnace, and his voice <supplied>was</supplied> like the sound of many waters, <verse-number id="Re 1:16">16</verse-number>and <supplied>he</supplied> had in his right hand seven stars, and a sharp double-edged sword coming out of his mouth, and his face <supplied>was</supplied> like the sun shining in its strength. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Re 1:17">17</verse-number>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead person, and he placed his right hand on me, saying, “Do not be afraid! I am the first and the last, <verse-number id="Re 1:18">18</verse-number>and the one who lives, and I was dead, and behold, I am living <idiom-start/>forever and ever<idiom-end/><note>Literally “for the ages of the ages”</note>, and I hold the keys of death and of Hades. <verse-number id="Re 1:19">19</verse-number>Therefore, write <supplied>the things</supplied> which you saw, and <supplied>the things</supplied> which are, and <supplied>the things</supplied> which are about to take place after these <supplied>things</supplied>. <verse-number id="Re 1:20">20</verse-number><supplied>As for</supplied> the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand and the seven gold lampstands—the seven stars are <supplied>the</supplied> angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are <supplied>the</supplied> seven churches. </p>
