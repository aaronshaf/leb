			<p><verse-number id="Mt 11:1">1</verse-number> And it happened that when Jesus had finished giving orders to his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and to preach in their towns. <verse-number id="Mt 11:2">2</verse-number>Now <supplied>when</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>when</supplied>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“heard”) which is understood as temporal</note> John<note>That is, John the Baptist</note> heard in prison the deeds of Christ, he sent <supplied>word</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> by his disciples <verse-number id="Mt 11:3">3</verse-number><supplied>and</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>and</supplied>” is supplied because the previous participle (“sent” in the previous verse) has been translated as a finite verb</note> said to him, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?” <verse-number id="Mt 11:4">4</verse-number>And Jesus answered <supplied>and</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>and</supplied>” is supplied because the previous participle (“answered”) has been translated as a finite verb</note> said to them, “Go <supplied>and</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>and</supplied>” is supplied because the previous participle (“go”) has been translated as a finite verb</note> tell John what you hear and see: <verse-number id="Mt 11:5">5</verse-number>the blind receive sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and the poor have good news announced to <supplied>them</supplied>.<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> <verse-number id="Mt 11:6">6</verse-number>And whoever is not offended by me is blessed.” </p>

A reed shaken by the wind? <verse-number id="Mt 11:8">8</verse-number>But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings. <verse-number id="Mt 11:9">9</verse-number>But why did you go out? To see a prophet?<note>Some manuscripts have “But what did you go out to see? A prophet?”</note> Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet! <verse-number id="Mt 11:10">10</verse-number>It is this man about whom it is written: </p>

			<ul>
				<li1>‘Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, </li1>
				<li2>who will prepare your way before you.’<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Mal 3:1">Mal 3:1; </cite>cf. <cite title="BibleLEB2: Mk 1:2">Mark 1:2</cite></note> </li2>

			<p/>
			<p><verse-number id="Mt 11:11">11</verse-number>Truly I say to you, among <supplied>those</supplied> born of women there has not arisen <supplied>one</supplied> greater than John the Baptist. But the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. <verse-number id="Mt 11:12">12</verse-number>But from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven is treated violently, and the violent claim<note>Or “seize”</note> it. <verse-number id="Mt 11:13">13</verse-number>For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John, <verse-number id="Mt 11:14">14</verse-number>and if you are willing to accept <supplied>it</supplied>,<note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation</note> he is Elijah, the one who is going to come. <verse-number id="Mt 11:15">15</verse-number>The one who has ears, let him hear! </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Mt 11:16">16</verse-number>“But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to one another, <verse-number id="Mt 11:17">17</verse-number>saying, </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>‘We played the flute for you and you did not dance; </li1>
				<li1>we sang a lament and you did not mourn.’ </li1>
			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p><verse-number id="Mt 11:18">18</verse-number>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon!’ <verse-number id="Mt 11:19">19</verse-number>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold, a man <supplied>who is</supplied> a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.”<note>Many Greek manuscripts, including most later ones, read “children”</note> </p>

			<pericope>Woes Pronounced on Unrepentant Towns</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Mt 11:20">20</verse-number>Then he began to reproach the towns in which the majority of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent: <verse-number id="Mt 11:21">21</verse-number>“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. <verse-number id="Mt 11:22">22</verse-number>Nevertheless I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and for Sidon on the day of judgment than for you! <verse-number id="Mt 11:23">23</verse-number>And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today. <verse-number id="Mt 11:24">24</verse-number>Nevertheless I tell you that it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you!” </p>
