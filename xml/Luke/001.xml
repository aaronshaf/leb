			<p><verse-number id="Lk 1:18">18</verse-number>And Zechariah said to the angel, “By what will I know this?

			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>“Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. </li1>
				<li1><verse-number id="Lk 1:31">31</verse-number>And behold, you will conceive in the womb and will give birth to a son, </li1>

			<p/>
			<p><verse-number id="Lk 1:36">36</verse-number>And behold, your relative Elizabeth—she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren. <verse-number id="Lk 1:37">37</verse-number>For <idiom-start/>nothing will be impossible with God<idiom-end/>.”<note>Literally “every thing will not be impossible with God”</note> </p>
