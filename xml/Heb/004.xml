			<pericope>The Rest that Remains for the People of God</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Heb 4:1">1</verse-number> Therefore let us fear, <supplied>while there</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>while</supplied>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“remains”) which is understood as temporal</note> remains a promise of entering into his rest, that none of you appear to fall short of <supplied>it</supplied>. <verse-number id="Heb 4:2">2</verse-number><idiom-start/>For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us<idiom-end/><note>Literally “for we are also having had the good news proclaimed”</note>, just as those also <supplied>did</supplied>, but the message <idiom-start/>they heard<idiom-end/><note>Literally “of hearing”</note> did not benefit them, <supplied>because they</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>because</supplied>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“united”) which is understood as causal</note> were not united with those who heard <supplied>it</supplied> in faith. <verse-number id="Heb 4:3">3</verse-number>For we who have believed enter into rest,<note>Some manuscripts have “that rest”</note> just as he has said, </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>“As I swore in my anger, </li1>
				<li1>‘<idiom-start/>They will never enter<idiom-end/><note>Literally “if they will enter”</note> into my rest.’ ”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Ps 95:11">Ps 95:11</cite></note> </li1>
			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p>And yet these works have been accomplished from the foundation of the world. <verse-number id="Heb 4:4">4</verse-number>For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh <supplied>day</supplied> in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Ge 2:2">Gen 2:2</cite></note> <verse-number id="Heb 4:5">5</verse-number>and in this <supplied>passage</supplied> again, ‘<idiom-start/>They will never enter<idiom-end/><note>Literally “if they will enter”</note> into my rest.’ ”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Ps 95:11">Ps 95:11</cite></note> <verse-number id="Heb 4:6">6</verse-number>Since therefore it remains <supplied>for</supplied> some to enter into it, and the ones to whom the good news was proclaimed previously did not enter because of disobedience, <verse-number id="Heb 4:7">7</verse-number>again he ordains a certain day, today, speaking by David after so long a time, just as had been said before, </p>
			<p/>
			<ul>
				<li1>“Today, if you hear his voice, </li1>
				<li1>do not harden your hearts.”<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Ps 95:7b–8">Ps 95:7b-8 </cite>(see also <cite title="BibleLEB2: Heb 3:7–8">Heb 3:7–8</cite>, <cite title="BibleLEB2: Heb 3:15">15</cite>)</note> </li1>
			</ul>
			<p/>
			<p><verse-number id="Heb 4:8">8</verse-number>For if Joshua had caused them to rest, he would not have spoken about another day after these <supplied>things</supplied>. <verse-number id="Heb 4:9">9</verse-number>Consequently a sabbath rest remains for the people of God. <verse-number id="Heb 4:10">10</verse-number>For the one who has entered into his rest has also himself rested from his works, just as God <supplied>did</supplied> from his own <supplied>works</supplied>. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Heb 4:11">11</verse-number>Therefore, let us make every effort to enter into that rest, in order that no one may fall in the same pattern of disobedience. <verse-number id="Heb 4:12">12</verse-number>For the word of God <supplied>is</supplied> living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, both joints and marrow, and able to judge the reflections and thoughts of the heart. <verse-number id="Heb 4:13">13</verse-number>And no creature is hidden in the sight of him, but all <supplied>things are</supplied> naked and laid bare to the eyes of him to whom <idiom-start/>we must give our account<idiom-end/><note>Literally “our account”</note>. </p>
			<p/>
			<pericope>Jesus Our Great High Priest</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Heb 4:14">14</verse-number>Therefore, <supplied>because we</supplied> have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. <verse-number id="Heb 4:15">15</verse-number>For we do not have a high priest who is not able to sympathize with our weaknesses, but who has been tempted in all <supplied>things</supplied> in the same way, without sin. <verse-number id="Heb 4:16">16</verse-number>Therefore let us approach with confidence to the throne of grace, in order that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. </p>
