			<pericope>The Greatness of Melchizedek</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Heb 7:1">1</verse-number> For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham <supplied>as he</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>as</supplied>” is supplied as a component of the participle (“was returning”) which is understood as temporal</note> was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,<note>This verse contains a number of quotations from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Ge 14:17–19">Gen 14:17–19</cite></note> <verse-number id="Heb 7:2">2</verse-number>to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth of everything<note>A quotation from <cite title="BibleLEB2: Ge 14:20">Gen 14:20</cite></note>—in the first place, <supplied>his name</supplied> is translated “king of righteousness,” and then also “king of Salem,” that is, “king of peace”; <verse-number id="Heb 7:3">3</verse-number>without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God—he remains a priest for all time. </p>
			<p><verse-number id="Heb 7:4">4</verse-number>But see how great this man <supplied>was</supplied>, to whom Abraham<note>Some manuscripts have “even Abraham”</note> the patriarch gave a tenth from the spoils! <verse-number id="Heb 7:5">5</verse-number>And indeed those of the sons of Levi who receive the priesthood have a commandment to collect a tenth from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, although <idiom-start/>they are descended from Abraham<idiom-end/><note>Literally “coming forth from the loins of Abraham”</note>. <verse-number id="Heb 7:6">6</verse-number>But the one who did not trace <supplied>his</supplied> descent from them collected tithes from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises. <verse-number id="Heb 7:7">7</verse-number>Now without any dispute the inferior is blessed by the more prominent. <verse-number id="Heb 7:8">8</verse-number>And in this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case it is testified that he lives. <verse-number id="Heb 7:9">9</verse-number>And, <idiom-start/>so to speak<idiom-end/><note>Literally “as if to say a word”</note>, even Levi, the one who receives tithes, has paid tithes through Abraham. <verse-number id="Heb 7:10">10</verse-number>For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him. </p>

			<pericope>The Superiority of Jesus to Melchizedek</pericope>
			<p><verse-number id="Heb 7:11">11</verse-number>Thus if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood, for on the basis of it the people received the law, what further need <supplied>is there</supplied> for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek and not said to be according to the order of Aaron? <verse-number id="Heb 7:12">12</verse-number>For <supplied>when</supplied><note tag="NOT_FOR_PRINT">﻿*Here “<supplied>when</supplied>” is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle (“changes”)</note> the priesthood changes, of necessity there is a change of the law also. <verse-number id="Heb 7:13">13</verse-number>For the one about whom these <supplied>things</supplied> are spoken belongs to another tribe from which no one has officiated at the altar. <verse-number id="Heb 7:14">14</verse-number>For <supplied>it is</supplied> evident that our Lord is a descendant of Judah, a tribe <supplied>with reference</supplied> to which Moses said nothing concerning priests. <verse-number id="Heb 7:15">15</verse-number>And it is still more clear, if another priest according to the likeness of Melchizedek arises, <verse-number id="Heb 7:16">16</verse-number>who has become <supplied>a priest</supplied> not according to a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life. <verse-number id="Heb 7:17">17</verse-number>For it is testified, </p>

			<p><verse-number id="Heb 7:18">18</verse-number>For on the one hand a preceding commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness <verse-number id="Heb 7:19">19</verse-number>(for the law <supplied>made</supplied> nothing perfect), but on the other hand <supplied>there is</supplied> the introduction of a better hope through which we draw near to God. <verse-number id="Heb 7:20">20</verse-number>And by as much as <supplied>this was</supplied> not without an oath (for these on the one hand <idiom-start/>have become priests<idiom-end/><note>Literally “are having become priests”</note> without an oath, <verse-number id="Heb 7:21">21</verse-number>but he with an oath by the one who said to him, </p>
